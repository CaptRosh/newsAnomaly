Security beefed up across Kashmir ahead of Home Minister Amit Shah's visit
SRINAGAR: Security has been beefed up across Kashmir ahead of Union Home Minister Amit Shah's maiden visit to the Valley after the abrogation of Article 370 on Saturday, officials said. They said a thick security cover has been thrown around the BJP office at Jawahar Nagar in the city where Shah is likely to pay a visit.  Similarly, roads leading to Sher-i-Kashmir International Convention Centre (SKICC) have been made off-limits for three days from Saturday as the Union home minister is expected to attend an event there, they added. It will be Shah's first visit to Kashmir after the Centre revoked J-K's special status and bifurcated the erstwhile state into union territories in August 2019. The officials said additional deployment of security forces has been made across the valley, especially in Srinagar. Official sources said 50 companies of additional paramilitary forces are being inducted into the valley in the wake of the recent spate of civilian killings. Bunkers manned by paramilitary CRPF have come up in several areas of the city as well in other parts of the valley, the officials said. They said the aim of constructing new bunkers and putting more personnel on the ground was to cut the free movement of militants. The officials said barricades have been put up on the roads across the valley, especially in the city, while frisking and checking of people has been intensified. The mobile internet services on a dozen towers -- mostly in the areas where non-local labourers were killed in the past week -- were snapped three days ago as part of the security measures, they said. The officials said police have started stringent checking of documents of two-wheelers plying on the roads and many have been seized by police. However, IGP, Kashmir zone, Vijay Kumar had said these steps were purely related to terror violence. "Seizing some bikes and shutting down of internet of some towers is purely related to #terror #violence. It has nothing to do with visit of the Hon'ble HM," he tweeted on Thursday.
