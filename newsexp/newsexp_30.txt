SRINAGAR: Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha on Sunday condemned the "despicable terror attack" in Kulgam district of Jammu and Kashmir, saying the security forces will give a befitting reply.

"I strongly condemn the despicable terror attack on Civilians in Kulgam. My heartfelt condolences to the bereaved families. I pray for the speedy recovery of injured," Sinha said in a tweet. He was reacting to the killing of two nob-local labourers in Kulgam district earlier in the evening. "Our security force will give a befitting reply to terrorists. J&K govt stand by the families in this time of grief," the LG said.
