Lakhimpur Kheri violence: Congress demands Ajay Mishra's scalp as BJP distances from his son
LUCKNOW: As the ruling BJP disassociated itself from Ashish Mishra ‘Monu’ in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence case, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi observed a maun vrat (silent protest) on Monday to step up the pressure on the Central government to sack Ashish’s father and junior Home Minister Ajay Mishra Teni. The move came after police produced evidence about the presence of Ashish in the convoy of cars where the incident took place in Lakhimpur Kheri on October 3.  The statement of UP BJP chief Swantantra Dev Singh to party cadre on Sunday that “we are not in politics to trample someone under an SUV” is being seen in this light. However, murmurs of letting the law taking its own course have started emerging from other BJP quarters, especially, after Ashish’s arrest on Saturday following the interrogation.
