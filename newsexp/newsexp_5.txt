"He (Yadav) cannot participate in the meetings and other activities of Samyukta Kisan Morcha," the farmer leader added. Yadav had attended the SKM's general body meeting on Thursday. Eight people were killed in Uttar Pradesh's Lakhimpur Kheri on October 3. Four of the eight victims were farmers, who were allegedly knocked down by a vehicle carrying BJP workers. Angry farmers then allegedly lynched some people in the vehicles. The other dead included two BJP workers and their driver.
