Good morning,  Big Story  With just four of 44 witness statements recorded so far, the Supreme Court asked the Uttar Pradesh government to  “dispel (the) impression” that it is “dragging its feet” in the Lakhimpur Kheri case. And when Senior Advocate Harish Salve, appearing for the state, said he had filed a status report regarding the investigation in a sealed cover, the bench responded saying it hadn’t asked for the report in a sealed cover. Only in the Express  Former international umpire SK Bansal, who was considered India’s lucky mascot in Test cricket, was a proud father when his twin sons took up umpiring. During cricket season, he would wait for them to return home and would want to know how their day went. But now, discussions about cricket and umpiring won’t be the same anymore at the Bansal household. One of the twins passed away following a heart attack.  Where is former Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh? The Indian Express visited Param Bir’s official residence in Mumbai and traced three other residential properties owned solely by him, or jointly with relatives, in Chandigarh, Navi Mumbai and Mumbai’s Juhu. It came across a group of bemused policemen, wary staff at a housing society — and a brother who described all the cases against Param Bir as “totally false and politically motivated”. From the Front Page  The bail plea of Aryan Khan, the son of Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan, was rejected by a special court on the ground that since his friend Arbaaz Merchant was found with contraband and knew about it, this amounted to “conscious possession”. Aryan’s lawyers have moved a plea in the Bombay High Court against the rejection of the bail application.   Data released by the Reserve Bank of India showed that monthly outward remittances under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS) hit an all-time high of $1.96 billion in August.

And it was India, along with Brazil, that recorded the biggest absolute increase in heat-related mortality between 2018 and 2019, according to the Lancet Countdown on health and climate change report, 2021. India is set to cross another significant milestone in its battle against the coronavirus pandemic. On Thursday, the country is expected to touch 100 crore Covid vaccinations — including both the first and second doses. A closer look at the vaccine data shows that India’s inoculation drive has been fairly equitable — with over 65 per cent of total vaccine doses being administered in rural areas. Overall, while 74 per cent of the estimated adult population have received the first dose, 31 per cent are fully vaccinated. The ongoing operation against militants holed up high in the Poonch ridges in Jammu is the longest in the area since 2003. Cross-border infiltrators have long been known to use the Poonch-Pir Panjal route to access South Kashmir.

It took a long drawn operation in 2003 to clear out the militants — and much longer to win over the local people. And Finally After failing to make the cut for the Tokyo Olympics, runner Hima Das was away from the track for almost three months. The forced break, coach Galina Bukharina believes, has made Hima reassess her career goals. “She got too much attention after the World Junior medal (2018) …I need her to understand that right now her future is in sport. If she wants to be in the sport she has to be a little more demanding to herself,” Bukharina said.  In today’s episode of the ‘3 Things’ podcast, we talk about why hundreds of migrants are now leaving J&K, and the destruction caused by the heavy rains in Uttarakhand.
