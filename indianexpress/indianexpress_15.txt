Quixplained: Should younger children get Covid-19 vaccine?
The decks are being cleared for children to be included in Indiaâ€™s Covid vaccination drive with the Governmentâ€™s Subject Expert Committee (SEC) recommending the grant of Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA) for Bharat Biotechâ€™s Covaxin in the age group of 2-18 years. The SECâ€™s recommendation to the Drug Controller General of India (DGCI) means that India is just one step away from formally clearing the vaccine for children. Sources told The Indian Express that the DGCI is expected to approve the SECâ€™s recommendation soon, potentially bringing an additional 25 crore beneficiaries under the vaccination umbrella. So far, India hasÂ approved Zydus Cadilaâ€™s vaccine for children aged above 12 years. Pfizerâ€™s double dose has been recommended for 12 years and above in the US, and a single dose for the same age level in the UK. Modernaâ€™s vaccine has also been approved by the UK regulator for those above 12 years old. ðŸ“£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.
