Need probe in all deals under Malik’s tenure as J&K Governor: Ram Madhav
Senior BJP leader Ram Madhav on Sunday called for an investigation into files cleared and “deals” made during the tenure of Satya Pal Malik as Governor of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir. Madhav’s remarks come in the backdrop of Malik’s allegations on October 17 of being offered a bribe to clear files belonging to “Ambani” and a senior “RSS functionary” during his tenure – August 2018-October 2019. Malik is currently serving as the Governor of Meghalaya. Madhav, who has served as the BJP in-charge of J&K, was interacting with reporters in Rajkot, where he had arrived to promote his recently published book “The Hindutva Paradigm”. He talked about his book at an event organised in the city. “Meghalaya Governor Satya Pal Malik has indirectly levelled allegations that there was a file in my name in J&K and that there was some talk about paying money in that respect. Such type of allegations are all false. There is no question of there being a file in my name or at my behest. It’s a false allegation…So far as his attempts to indirectly point at me by repeatedly referring to ‘one RSS functionary’, I’ll explore the legal remedy for this, once I return to Delhi,” Madhav said. “We will certainly initiate legal action but I also want (investigated) all the deals of his time, as he is saying he cancelled two of them. Why were they cancelled? If the government had finalised some deal there should be an investigation into why it was cancelled? I don’t know what deals he is talking about, but let there be an investigation into those deals, as well as, all others,” he added.  A national executive member of the RSS at present, Madhav further said: “I want these allegations probed… because as far as my knowledge of Governors goes, no officer will go to a Governor and tell him to sign files.” He also pushed for an investigation into the “officer” who allegedly offered the bribe to Malik. “If he has gumption to go to the Governor and make him an offer, what is the position of the Governor? I want all these aspects investigated,” Madhav said. Malik had levelled the allegations while speaking at a public meeting in Rajasthan on October 17. 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.
