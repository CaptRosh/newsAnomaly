Meeting BJP worker‚Äôs family was an act of ‚Äòhumanity‚Äô, says Yogendra Yadav
A day after he was suspended from the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), social activist Yogendra Yadav said he visited the dead BJP worker‚Äôs family to share their grief since it is part of Indian culture. Yadav was suspended for a month for visiting the family of Subham Mishra, a Bharatiya Janata Party worker who was killed in the October 3 Lakhimpur Kheri violence. Yadav said he regretted not consulting other members of the SKM before his meeting and it saddens him to have hurt their feelings. ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§Ø‡•Å‡§ï‡•ç‡§§ ‡§ï‡§ø‡§∏‡§æ‡§® ‡§Æ‡•ã‡§∞‡•ç‡§ö‡§æ ‡§ï‡•á ‡§´‡§º‡•à‡§∏‡§≤‡•á ‡§™‡§∞ @_YogendraYadav ‡§ï‡§æ ‡§¨‡§Ø‡§æ‡§® ‡§Æ‡•à‡§Ç ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§Ø‡•Å‡§ï‡•ç‡§§ ‡§ï‡§ø‡§∏‡§æ‡§® ‡§Æ‡•ã‡§∞‡•ç‡§ö‡§æ ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§∏‡§æ‡§Æ‡•Ç‡§π‡§ø‡§ï ‡§®‡§ø‡§∞‡•ç‡§£‡§Ø ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§ï‡•ç‡§∞‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§ï‡§æ ‡§∏‡§Æ‡•ç‡§Æ‡§æ‡§® ‡§ï‡§∞‡§§‡§æ ‡§π‡•Ç‡§Ç ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§á‡§∏ ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§ï‡•ç‡§∞‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§ï‡•á ‡§§‡§π‡§§ ‡§¶‡•Ä ‡§ó‡§à ‡§∏‡§ú‡§æ ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§∏‡§π‡§∞‡•ç‡§∑ ‡§∏‡•ç‡§µ‡•Ä‡§ï‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§ï‡§∞‡§§‡§æ ‡§π‡•Ç‡§Ç‡•§ ‡§á‡§∏ ‡§ê‡§§‡§ø‡§π‡§æ‡§∏‡§ø‡§ï ‡§ï‡§ø‡§∏‡§æ‡§® ‡§Ü‡§Ç‡§¶‡•ã‡§≤‡§® ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§∏‡§´‡§≤‡§§‡§æ ‡§ï‡•á ‡§≤‡§ø‡§è ‡§Æ‡•à‡§Ç ‡§™‡§π‡§≤‡•á ‡§∏‡•á ‡§≠‡•Ä ‡§ú‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§¶‡§æ ‡§≤‡§ó‡§® ‡§∏‡•á ‡§ï‡§æ‡§Æ ‡§ï‡§∞‡§§‡§æ ‡§∞‡§π‡•Ç‡§Ç‡§ó‡§æ‡•§ pic.twitter.com/EdRgvErqDT ‚Äî Swaraj India (@_SwarajIndia) October 22, 2021 ‚ÄúIn any movement, collective opinion prevails above individual understanding. I am sorry that I did not talk to other comrades of SKM before taking this decision,‚Äù he said through a statement. ‚ÄúI respect the collective decision-making process of the SKM and gladly accept the punishment awarded under this process. ‚ÄúI will continue to work more diligently than ever for the success of this historic peasant movement,‚Äù he added. Yadav defended his meeting with the Mishra family calling it an act of ‚Äúhumanity‚Äù. ‚ÄúIt is in line with humanity and Indian culture to share the misery of even those who are your sworn enemies,‚Äù he said. He said he met families of the farmers and the journalist killed in the same incident before moving on to meet family of the BJP worker. He hoped that his public expression of sentiments will only strengthen farmers‚Äô movement. ‚ÄúI hope that a fruitful dialogue can be started on this question,‚Äù he said.
