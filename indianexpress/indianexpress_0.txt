In the video clip, Vajpayee is heard telling a gathering that farmers cannot be scared.  “If the government will suppress (farmers), misuse laws and repress a peaceful agitation, then we will not shy away from joining the farmers’ struggle and standing with them,” he is heard saying. Gandhi has also sought stringent action against those responsible for the death of four farmers after vehicles, allegedly linked to BJP leaders, ran over them in Uttar Pradesh’s Lakhimpur Kheri. He was recently dropped from the BJP national executive in what was seen as an indication of the party leadership’s unhappiness with the Pilibhit MP. 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.
