Citizenship Bill protests continue in Northeast
A ‘Black Day’ was observed across the Northeast on Saturday following a strike call by North East Students’ Organisation, an umbrella body of student groups in the region, to protest against the crackdown on those demonstrating against the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2016 in Tripura and Manipur this week. Sporadic demonstrations continued in parts of Assam and a shutdown was observed in Tripura Tribal Areas Autonomous District Council (TTAADC) on Saturday. Black flags were raised by student bodies across the region, including at the headquarters of the All Assam Students’ Union (AASU) in Guwahati. A sedition complaint was lodged against Assam minister Himanta Biswa Sarma over alleged communal remarks.

In Tripura, Upendra Debbarma, advisor to Twipra Students’ Federation and vice-chairman of NESO, said, “Today has been peaceful and a highly successful strike.” In Assam’s Silchar, authorities at Assam University on Saturday imposed restrictions on protests on campus without prior approval.

Dutta took back his comments later after drawing sharp criticism. Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti activists lodged a complaint of sedition against Assam minister Himanta Biswa Sarma at Laluk police station in Lakhimpur district.
