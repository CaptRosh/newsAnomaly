"UP Violence: Ashish Mishra is junior Union Home Minister Ajay Mishra's sonLakhimpur Kheri, UP: Uttar Pradesh Police are attempting to ""recreate"" the horrific events that took place at Lakhimpur Kheri earlier this month, when four peacefully protesting farmers and a journalist were mowed down by a convoy of three vehicles, one of which belongs to Union Minister Ajay Mishra.The police brought Mr Mishra's son, Ashish, who is accused of the farmers' murder to the scene, along with his friend and co-accused Ankit Das, and are using cop cars to recreate the events of that day.Ashish Mishra has denied he was at the crime scene when the murders took place; he has claimed he was in his paternal village (around two km away) and stayed there all day.Visuals filmed by journalists at the scene showed a police jeep driving at high speed and crushing dummies (meant to represent the farmers who were run over) placed on the road.Another clip showed the crime scene secured with police tape; this, though, has raised questions about why the police did not secure the scene immediately after the incident and allowed everyone, including  and the media, unfiltered access for at least 48 hours.Other visuals - a decidedly surreal one - showed Ashish waving to crowds from inside the police jeep.Murder accused Ashish Mishra waving to crowds from inside a police jeepAshish Mishra was arrested last week - after spending nearly seven days as a free man despite being named in the FIR (first information report). Yesterday he was denied bail by a local court.Police remand ends today but they are likely to seek further custody so they can interrogate him.Ashish's arrest followed 12 hours of questioning by members of the police team formed to investigate the Lakhimpur incident, and that questioning came after an intervention by the Supreme Court, which asked UP Police if it was treating Ashish Mishra differently because of his high-profile father.The police had earlier denied that Ashish Mishra's obvious family connections had influenced them.A special police team is trying to recreate the events of October 2, when four farmers were run downYesterday a delegation of Congress leaders, led by Rahul Gandhi, met President Ram Nath Kovind, and urged him to speak to the government on this issue.The Congress and other opposition parties have demanded that Ajay Mishra - who, as the junior Home Minister, oversees national policing issues - step down in order to ensure a fair probe.""The families believe that till his minister father is in the post there can be no justice. This is also the demand of the people of the UP and all-right thinking people of the country... The president said he will consult the government,"" Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, who was part of the delegation, said.Rahul Gandhi demanded that two sitting Supreme Court judges should probe the Lakhimpur incident - currently being investigated by a SIT from UP Police. The Supreme Court, meanwhile, earlier ruled out a CBI investigation of the deaths, citing ""people involved"" - seen as a reference to Ajay Mishra.PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.comBoth Ashish Mishra and his father have denied all charges.Mr Mishra told NDTV the car belonged to his family but neither he nor his son were in it at the time.

"According to PTI, the video tweeted by Varun Gandhi was of Atal Bihari Vajpayee in 1980New Delhi: BJP MP Varun Gandhi - dumped from his party's National Executive this month after calling  for justice for the families of farmers killed in UP's Lakhimpur Kheri, and speaking out in support of other farmers protesting the centre's new laws - is in no mood to back down.This morning Mr Gandhi tweeted an undated video of (a very young-looking) Atal Bihari Vajpayee, in which the late former Prime Minister warns the government against intimidating farmers.According to news agency PTI the video is from 1980 and Mr Vajpayee is cautioning the then Indira Gandhi government against repressing farmers.""... warn the government against intimidating farmers. Don't try to scare us... Farmers are not going to be scared. We don't want to use farmers' movement for politics..."" Mr Vajpayee says in the video.""We support their genuine demands, and if the government tries to scare us, or misuse the laws, or disregard the peaceful movement of farmers, we will also become part of the movement,"" he adds.""Wise words from a big-hearted leader,"" is Mr Gandhi's comment on the shared video.Wise words from a big-hearted leader… pic.twitter.com/xlRtznjFAx— Varun Gandhi (@varungandhi80) October 14, 2021Earlier this month Varun Gandhi was dropped from the BJP's 80-member National Executive, as were his mother Maneka Gandhi and former Union Minister Birender Singh; all three have been seen as being sympathetic towards the farmers' protests against the centre's laws.Mr Gandhi is also the only BJP member, so far, to speak up on the Lakhimpur Kheri issue, in which Ashish Mishra, the son of junior Home Minister Ajay Mishra, is accused of murdering four farmers.The Pilibhit MP has not only demanded ""accountability"" but also wrote to Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath to demand a CBI probe and Rs 1 crore compensation for the dead farmers' families.This week he also targeted Ajay Mishra over his comment that Khalistanis had engineered the Lakhimpur events; without naming him he slammed it as an attempt to give communal colour.Last week he tweeted a video of the black SUV ploughing through a group of peaceful protesters from behind, tagging it ""murder"" and saying that the video was enough to ""shake the soul"".The video is crystal clear. Protestors cannot be silenced through murder. There has to be accountability for the innocent blood of farmers that has been spilled and justice must be delivered before a message of arrogance and cruelty enters the minds of every farmer. ???????????????? pic.twitter.com/Z6NLCfuujK— Varun Gandhi (@varungandhi80) October 7, 2021The farmers' months-long protest against the centre's new farm laws has formed the backdrop for a series of hostile clashes between the ruling BJP and opposition parties, including a fierce stand-off during the monsoon session of Parliament that included physical confrontations in the final week.PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.comThe protests have also included violent clashes between farmers and police in various states, most notably BJP-ruled Haryana. The violence has left dozens injured on both sides and drawn scathing criticism from the opposition, which has accused the centre of using brutal force against farmers.With input from PTI",ndtv,"Sidelined, BJP's Varun Gandhi Doubles Down With Vajpayee Video On Farmers",L

"Lakhimpur violence, in which 4 farmers were killed, is ""absolutely condemnable,"" Nirmala Sitharaman said.Boston: The Lakhimpur Kheri violence, in which four farmers were killed, is ""absolutely condemnable,"" Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has said, emphasising that there are issues of such nature happening in other parts of India equally which should be raised ""when they happen and not when it suits others"" because there is a BJP government in Uttar Pradesh.Ms Sitharaman, who is on an official visit to the US, was responding to a question during a conversation at Harvard Kennedy School on Tuesday about the killing of four farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri and the arrest of Ashish Mishra, son of Union Minister of State for Home Ajay Mishra.She was asked why there is no word on this from the prime minister, senior ministers and why there is a ""defensive reaction"" when somebody asks questions about such things.""No, absolutely not... It's nice of you to have picked up that one incident which is absolutely condemnable, every one of us say that. Equally there are instances happening elsewhere, is my concern.""""India has issues of such nature happening in very many different parts of the country equally. I would like you, and many others, including Dr Amartya Sen, who all know India, to raise it at every time when it happens, not just raise it when it suits us because it's a state where BJP is in power, one of my cabinet colleague's son is probably in trouble, and also assume that it's actually them who did it and not anybody else. Due course of justice will also have a complete inquiry process to establish it,"" she said.""And it's not being defensive about my party or my Prime Minister. It's being defensive about India. I will talk for India, I will talk for justice for the poor. I will not be mocked at. And if it is mocking, I will be defensive to stand up and say 'Sorry, let's talk on facts''. That's my answer for you,"" she said.Ashish Mishra was named in an FIR following allegations that he was in one of the vehicles that mowed down four farmers protesting over UP Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya's visit on October 3.To a question on the farmers' protests, Ms Sitharaman said that the three acts which the government brought in were discussed by the various parliamentary committees over a decade.She said all the three acts have been discussed variously by the State governments, by the Center after the BJP came into power in 2014.""This has been in the making for a decade now. Every stakeholder has been consulted,"" she said.""When the farm laws were brought in the Lok Sabha, there was an elaborate discussion and the agriculture minister gave his reply as well. It was only when it came to the Rajya Sabha, there was a lot of noise and disturbance,"" she said.Thousands of farmers from Punjab, Haryana and several other states have been protesting on various borders of Delhi since November 26 last year, seeking repeal of three farm laws enacted in September.Dubbing these laws as ""anti-farmer"", these farmers claim that the newly enacted legislations would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the ""mercy"" of big corporations.Ms Sitharaman said the protesters belong to one state and some parts of other states - ""Punjab, Haryana and some parts of western Uttar Pradesh.""She said the government has been saying that it is willing to talk with the protesters and has been engaging with them.The government has asked pointedly what is that one aspect in any one of the three laws which have been passed to which the protesters object, she said. ""We are willing to talk about it, tell us that one particular aspect in any one of the three laws. Till date, we have not had even one particular aspect which is being questioned. And therefore, the protesters are not sure on what score they are protesting, what is it that they are objecting.""Then there's this issue about the minimum support price to be given to farmers,"" she said, adding that the MSP are announced well in time and the farmers can decide whether they want to grow a crop or not and they can otherwise choose to grow something else.She said once the farmers choose to grow any of these, for which a minimum support price is announced and procurements are done, through direct benefit transfer using technology, money is deposited as a lump sum into their accounts.""The highest amount of procurement, the largest ever payment per farmer under the minimum support price which is declared has happened in the last seven years after Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi has come. Highest ever.""""The number of farmers, the total quantum of money, total quantum of grain procured in each one of them - the highest as has happened season after season in the last seven years,"" she said.Highlighting that there are recorded conversations ""which you can see of farmers even from Punjab, even from Haryana"", she said farmers have got the entire amount into their account.""This is verifiable, not a claim which I''m making.

"Four farmers were run over by son of Union Minister Ajay MishraNew Delhi: The BJP held a four-hour meeting in Delhi to discuss the assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh due next year. The key question at the meet, sources said, was likely to be the possible fallout of last week's events in Lakhimpur Kheri, where four farmers were run over on October 3 -- allegedly by Ashish Mishra, the son of Union Minister Ajay Mishra.Junior home minister in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, Ajay Mishra has not resigned despite the nationwide outrage and opposition demands.Sources said there is no possibility of resignation for now. At a meeting with his boss, Union Home Minister Amit Shah last week, Mr Mishra said he or his son were not at the spot.

"Union Minister's son Ashish Mishra was today sent to 3-day police custody. He reportedly gave evasive answers about the Lakhimpur Kheri violenceLucknow: Union Minister's son Ashish Mishra, accused of running over farmers in Uttar Pradesh's Lakhimpur Kheri triggering violence that claimed eight lives earlier this month, was sent to police custody for three days on Monday.Son of Union Minister Ajay Mishra, Ashish Mishra was arrested on Saturday after being questioned for over 12 hours in Lakhimpur Kheri. The police said he had been giving ""evasive answers"" and not cooperating.His arrest came five days after he was named in a murder case. The charges against him usually merit an immediate arrest and questions have been raised whether he was afforded VIP treatment because of his father.According to top sources in the Uttar Pradesh Police, the minister's son was not able explain several points about his whereabouts during the incident on October 3. They were also yet to get answers to questions surrounding the discovery of two empty cartridges at the scene which back the farmers' claims of being fired at and contest those by Mr Mishra's men who say there was no firing.Witnesses have said he was missing from the event he said he was at between 2 and 4 pm - around the time the incident took place, his phone location showed him closer to the crime scene, and the driver of the SUV that rammed the farmers did not appear to match the description made by him.The senior UP Police officer, who waited three hours for Ashish Mishra to show up on Friday, questioned him till late into the night a day later after he was brought in through a backdoor, helping him avoid the media gaggle. In another questionable move, the UP cops had issued notice to Ashish Mishra under a section of law which concerns attendance of witnesses - not the accused.The arrest came a day after the Supreme Court reminded the Uttar Pradesh government that the law must take its course against ""whoever is involved""  amid nationwide outrage over the incident and mounting pressure from farmer groups.PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.comAshish Mishra has been named in an FIR filed by the farmers who said he drove into a gathering of slogan-shouting demonstrators amid a peaceful black flag protest last Sunday.

"The Punjab unit of the BJP has asked the state DGP to book SKM leaders for hurting Hindu sentiments by giving a call for burning effigies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah  on Dussehra. Urging the police to ensure that the “sanctity of the religious festival” is not disturbed, the BJP said that that Article 19 of the Constitution gives right to protest but with restrictions. “But no one can be permitted to disrupt peace and harmony of the state,” said Dr Subhash Sharma, general secretary of the Punjab BJP. He added: “Few leaders of the SKM are deliberately and maliciously hurting the feelings of the society, especially Hindus, by giving a call that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah’s effigies will be burnt on Dussehra day. This is hurting the feelings of people.” Dr Darshan Pal, member of SKM and president of Krantikari Kisan Union, Punjab, said, “Yes, we have given a call to burn effigies of the PM and Home Minister and we stand by it. We have asked people to avoid it in sensitive areas, but this call stands for the entire nation.” He said, “Let people complain about us, however effigy burning is not a new thing, it has been happening for the past many years. Employee unions and many other unions had been burning such effigies in the past as well. Last year too we had burnt effigies on Dussehra but at that time aandolan was more active in Punjab and now it is across the country. ” He added, “Dussehra means victory of good over evil…We have been struggling against farm laws since June 2020 and in between many incidents have happened including Lakhimpur Kheri. So, farmers will be lodging their protest against evil forces in the country.” Jagmohan Singh Patiala, general secretary of BKU (Dakaunda) and member of SKM added, “We are not stopping anyone from celebrating Dussehra the way they like. However, we are issuing an appeal to people to burn effigies of the PM and Home Minister….Moreover, effigies were burnt even last year in a similar manner at many places on Dussehra. ” BJP’s Punjab spokesperson Anil Sareen added, “It needs to be asked as to why farmer unions protest on the days when Hindus celebrate their festivals. Last year too they had burnt effigies like this only on Dussehra day. This year too they have given a call.  They burn effigies every now and then, let them do it. However, why do they give such calls on Hindu festivals. On Diwali last year, they observed Black Diwali.  On Raksha Bandhan this year, chakka jam was done in Punjab as part of ongoing protest. I appeal to farmer unions that they should not to use festivals for protests, they can do them on other dates as well.”  Dr Sharma also wrote to the DGP that Supreme Court in other cases had already given directions to police to take preventive measures and remedies in case some forces try to breach peace and create disharmony on religious festivals .”Our Festivals are a part of our lives and many people of state celebrate Dussehra with religious purposes,” said Dr Sharma.  “The pious and religious festival of Dussehra is a primary religious occasion in the country and any attempt to disrespect and disturb it should be curtailed,” said Dr Subhash Sharma.

"TEN DAYS after four farmers were killed in Lakhimpur Kheri when a group of farm protesters were hit by a convoy of vehicles, including one owned by Union MoS Ajay Mishra, and four others lost their lives in the violence that followed, UP Law Minister Brijesh Pathak Wednesday became the first senior BJP leader to visit the area. But the Minister left after visiting the families of two of those killed: BJP worker Shubham Mishra and MoS Ajay Mishra’s driver Hari Om Mishra. He did not meet the families of four others from the area who lost their lives: farmers Nachhattar Singh and Lovepreet Singh, BJP worker Shyam Sunder Nishad, and journalist Raman Kashyap. The two other farmers who were killed, Gurvinder Singh and Diljeet Singh, were from the neighbouring Bahraich district. When contacted by The Indian Express, Pathak said: “I will visit their families of Nishad and Kashyap as soon as the situation normalises in that region as they live close to the spot where the incident took place.” The Minister also said that he would hold talks with the families of the farmers who were killed “once the situation normalises”. Opposition parties, however, criticised Pathak’s visit and described it as “an attempt to divert attention” from the incident. Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait warned that it “may be a bit too early for a BJP Minister to visit the families” of the farmers killed. “There may be a reaction from the families, so if someone has to go, permission should be taken from the families,” he said. BJP district chief Sunil Singh said the family of Nishad, which belongs to an OBC community, has been assured that another delegation led by the party’s state general secretary Amar Pal Maurya would visit Lakhimpur Kheri on October 16. He said Maurya’s delegation would also visit the family of Kashyap. The families of Nachhattar Singh and Lovepreet Singh were not available for comment. Guru Sevak, the brother of 18-year-old Gurvinder Singh in Bahraich, said the Minister “should not come for politics, but to share our sorrow”. “If he wants to come, he should remove his party’s flag and come,” he said. In his interaction with the families of Shubham Mishra and Hari Om Mishra, Law Minister Pathak promised to fulfil their demands, including the issuance of “arms licence, status of BJP martyr and a fair investigation in their killings”. Asked about his visit, Pathak told The Indian Express: “I visited the families to offer condolences and assure them of a fair investigation. The families had some demands, including for a weapon licence as there is a security threat. I promised them that it would be looked into as per the norms.” Speaking to The Indian Express on Wednesday afternoon, the family of Shyam Sunder Nishad, who was the BJP ‘mandal mantri’ for the Singahi area in Lakhimpur Kheri, said no one contacted them regarding Pathak’s visit to the area. “No Minister has come to meet us, and we have not been given any information about any Minister’s visit by local officials. We would like to meet whoever wants to share our grief,” said Nishad’s brother Sanjay. Nishad (30) is survived by his parents, Balak Ram (52) and Phoolmati (47), wife Ruby (25), and two daughters, one aged three and the other just seven months old. Kashyap’s family also said that no one had contacted them about the Minister’s visit. “We are waiting for people to come and share our grief. He is a Minister, so he could have met us. No one from the administration told us anything about any visit,” said Kashyap’s brother Pawan. Kashyap’s family has claimed that he was also killed after being hit by the convoy. Apart from his father, Kashyap is survived by his wife Aradhna (32) and their two children, aged 11 and 3. In the Shivpuri area, where BJP worker Shubham Mishra (26) hailed from, his uncle Anoop Mishra said: “The Law Minister met us at the venue for the daswan (10th day since death). He wanted to meet us at home but we were at the mourning site. The Minister told us that our son will be given the status of martyr by the BJP.” According to him, Pathak also assured the family that action will be taken against those responsible for his death. “He assured us that our family will be looked after, and that our daughter-in-law will get a job,” the uncle said. Shubham Mishra, who was a businessman, is survived by his wife Rekha and one-year-old daughter Angel.  Pathak also met the family of Hari Om Mishra (27) in Parsehra village. “He promised us that our family will be looked after. He also assured us that the BJP will give Hari Om the status of a martyr,” Hari Om’s cousin, Rajnikant Mishra, said. Asked about Pathak’s visit, Congress state chief Ajay Kumar Lallu, who had visited Lakhimpur Kheri along with Priyanka Gandhi, said, “This is now just an attempt by the Government to divert the focus and course of investigation. This government protects criminals and such visits, 10 days after the incident, shows that they have no intention of ensuring justice for the victims.” Samajwadi Party spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary said: “This visit has no meaning and is just a formality after so much pressure has been built by the Opposition.

"At Banveerpur, Union minister Ajay Mishra’s village, most are willing to testify that his son Ashish Mishra was present at the venue of a wrestling event on October 3 when a convoy of vehicles, including one owned by his father, mowed down a group of farmers, killing four of them and a journalist. Despite his arrest, Ashish, popular as Monu Bhaiyya, most villagers vouch for his innocence. For them, among his three siblings, Ashish, the eldest, remains Ajay Mishra’s political and business heir. “After Teniji [Ajay Mishra] became the MP from Lakhimpur Kheri seat, it was Monu Bhaiyya who took over his reign in the district. People who would come to meet Teniji to resolve their issues started meeting Monu Bhaiyya,” says Akash Mittal, the 32-year-old pradhan of Banveerpur. Ashish also took charge of the daily running of the family business – a rice mill and two petrol pumps owned by his father. According to villagers, Ashish handled his father’s political campaign in the 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha polls. “He was always working behind the scenes and organising things. His popularity is unmatched. He is Ajay Mishra’s uttaradhikari (successor),” says Amar, a 31-year-old villager. “Unme jo baat hai, woh Abhimanyu bhaiyya mein nahi hai. Woh thode seedhe hain (the qualities he possesses is not in his brother Abhimanyu, who is rather simple).” A Samajwadi Party leader in Nighasan, from where Ashish is keen to contest the upcoming Assembly polls on a BJP ticket, says, “His image is not very different from his father Ajay’s.” He refuses to speak more about him. “I have to live here,” he says. According to Tikonia Station House Officer Balendu Gautam, two cases were filed against Ashish between 2007 and 2009 at the local police station. “They are related to assault charges,” says the police officer. He refuses to divulge more. According to a villager, Banveerpur fears the Mishra family. “No one will say anything against Ashish or anyone from his family even after he killed four people. Such is their stature in the village,” alleges the 37-year-old farmer. Across Nighasan block and Banveerpur, Ashish’s political ambitions and presence is clear – and are there to see on the walls. “Nighasan janta ki pukaar, Monu Bhaiyya ab ki baar (people of Nighasan want Monu Bhaiyaa this time),” says one of the slogans painted on a wall. “He had sought a ticket in 2017 Assembly polls too, but the party fielded senior leader Patel Ramkumar Verma,” says a local BJP leader, referring to the Union minister’s former political mentor. Ties between the two leaders, however, soured over the years, say party leaders. Nighasan is currently held by Verma’s son Shashank, who won the 2019 bypoll on a BJP ticket after his father’s death. According to a BJP leader based in Lakhimpur Kheri, the farmer deaths may have dented Ashish’s chances of getting a party ticket. “This time, Monu had a good chance of getting the ticket to contest from Nighasan, but let’s see what happens now. Shashank is the sitting MLA. So, he is also a good choice for the BJP,” he says. “It is difficult to predict what happens next, but the October 3 incident will definitely affect his chances. Tikonia mein bahot bada kaand ho gaya. Poore desh mein baat ho rahi hai (the country is talking about what happened in Tikonia),” he says. “The party is under pressure.” This setback to his political dreams – which has led other ticket hopefuls to jump into the fray over the past few days – is perhaps one challenge Ashish would have wanted to avoid. Despite his fondness for “kushti” (wrestling). Villagers and those close to his family say Ashish likes challenges, when it comes to wrestling. “He is not shy of taking on a wrestler from the village. Baaki zyada koi shauk nahi, par kushti karte hain (he is passionate about wrestling),” says a local BJP leader, close to the Mishra family.  A science graduate from Lucknow University, Ashish got married to Rinki Mishra from Bheera town in Lakhimpur Kheri in 2014. “It was an arranged marriage. Monu Bhaiyya’s wife is the sister of BJP leader Achal Mishra. Her father Uddhav Shyam Mishra was also associated with the BJP,” says a local BJP leader. The couple have two school-going daughters. While Ashish used to live at Banveerpur, his wife and daughters lived in Lakhimpur Kheri city. They would visit him on the weekends, says the village head. 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

They should be asked how expensive is mustard oil now… The ones who increased the prices of everything are also selling everything else.

Today, petrol has crossed Rs 100, and diesel is creeping behind. They have brought three farm laws that will snatch away your farming. It will not increase your produce, but will only take away your farming. You will have to work as labour on your own farming.

The Special Investigation Team (SIT) of UP Police, meanwhile, arrested two more persons — 38-year-old Ankit Das and 37-year-old Lateef alias Kala — in connection with the incident, taking the total number of arrests in the case to six. Ankit Das, a resident of Lucknow, is a close aide of Ashish Mishra and nephew of former Rajya Sabha MP Akhilesh Das. Lateef alias Kala, a resident of Lakhimpur Kheri, is an accountant of Ankit Das, said police, adding that he and Ankit Das were in one of the three vehicles in the convoy that ran over the protesting farmers. Both were later produced before a local court which sent them to three-day police custody, beginning Thursday.  “The court allowed the SIT’s application and sent Ankit and Lateef to three-day police custody,” said government counsel (Lakhimpur Kheri) SP Yadav. On Tuesday, Das and Kale had moved an application for surrender before the chief judicial magistrate after investigators summoned them for questioning. In a video that went viral in the aftermath of the incident, a man with head injuries was heard telling a policeman that he was in the vehicle with four other people, including Ankit Das. The man in the video provided the registration number of the vehicle — described as a Toyota Fortuner — and claimed that it belonged to Ankit Das. “Since police have arrested Ankit Das and Lateef we would request the court to expunge surrender application,” said advocate Awadesh Kumar Singh. 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

"In an attempt to keep the Lakhimpur Kheri violence and killings politically alive, a high-level delegation of Congress leaders on Wednesday met President Ram Nath Kovind and urged him to dismiss Union Minister of State for Home Affairs Ajay Mishra Teni, whose son Ashish Mishra was arrested, and to direct setting up of an independent judicial investigation by a commission comprising two sitting judges of the Supreme Court of India or a high court. Senior Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi, Leader of the Opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge, A K Antony, Ghulam Nabi Azad and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra told the President that the “unforgivable and merciless murder of farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri” has “scarred the soul of India”. “This deliberate act of murder, in broad daylight followed by the audacious reactions of the State and Central Governments, has completely eroded the people’s faith in those tasked with bringing these perpetrators to justice,” they said in a memorandum submitted to the President. Referring to the continuing protests by farmer groups on the outskirts of Delhi against the three contentious farm laws, the Congress leaders told the President that “the Modi Government has refused to relent or have a meaningful conversation with them (the farmers). Their policy appears to be to “tire & retire” the Anndatas, a strategy doomed to failure.” “In this context, it is important to note that on September 27th, 2021, the day of the Bharat Bandh called by protesting farmers against the three black laws, Ajay Mishra Teni, MoS Home Affairs, in a public function openly threatened the agitating farmers and even boasted about his dubious antecedents. The video of his speech has been played on different public platforms and is available in the public domain. How can justice be done when the original provocation came from Union MoS Home Affairs himself?” the memorandum said. “Thereafter, on October 3rd, as farmers carried out their peaceful protests, a cavalcade of vehicles (with two of the cars being owned by the Minister and his family) mowed down four farmers (and a journalist) from behind. It was one of the most gruesome and premeditated acts of bone-chilling murder ever seen and caught on camera. Multiple eyewitnesses have confirmed that the Minister’s son, Ashish Mishra was in the vehicle.” “As has become the norm, the Uttar Pradesh Government and Police flatly refused to lodge an FIR and then refused to arrest the accused….,” the memorandum said.  The Congress leaders wondered “which police official would dare to fairly investigate the son of Union MoS Home Affairs with the father occupying a position of such high influence and who enjoys continued endorsements from both the central and the state governments.” “In these difficult circumstances, we call upon you as the custodian of our Constitution and the moral compass to this Government to immediately dismiss Union MOS Home Affairs Ajay Mishra Teni and to direct an independent judicial investigation by a Commission comprising of two sitting judges of the Supreme Court of India or the High Court,” it said. 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

"The Lakhimpur Kheri violence, in which four farmers were killed, is “absolutely condemnable,” Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Tuesday. However, Sitharaman also said that there are issues of such nature happening in other parts of India equally which should be raised “when they happen and not when it suits others” because there is a BJP government in Uttar Pradesh. Sitharaman, who is on an official visit to the US, was responding to a question during a conversation at Harvard Kennedy School on Tuesday about the killing of four farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri and the arrest of Ashish Mishra, son of Union Minister of State for Home Ajay Mishra. Sitharaman was asked why there is no word on this from the prime minister, senior ministers and why there is a “defensive reaction” when somebody asks questions about such things.  “No, absolutely not… It’s nice of you to have picked up that one incident which is absolutely condemnable, every one of us say that. Equally, there are instances happening elsewhere, is my concern,” she said. “And it’s not being defensive about my party or my Prime Minister. It’s being defensive about India. I will talk for India, I will talk for justice for the poor. I will not be mocked at. And if it is mocking, I will be defensive to stand up and say ‘Sorry, let’s talk on facts’. That’s my answer for you,” Sitharaman further added. Stating that India has issues happening in different parts of the country, Sitharaman urged people to talk about all of them “equally.” ” I would like you, and many others, including Dr. Amartya Sen, who all know India, to raise it at every time when it happens, not just raise it when it suits us because it’s a state where BJP is in power, one of my cabinet colleague’s son is in probably trouble, and also assume that it’s actually them who did it and not anybody else. Due course of justice will also have a complete inquiry process to establish it,” she said. On October 3, a convoy of three vehicles drove through a crowd of protesting farmers in Tikonia, Lakhimpur Kheri district of Uttar Pradesh. One of the cars belonged to Union Minister Ajay Mishra, and his son, Ashish, is alleged to have been behind the wheel. Four farmers were killed in the incident, while four others, including the Minister’s driver, two BJP workers and a journalist, died in subsequent protests. While Ajay Mishra has maintained his son was not present at the site of the accident, Ashish was arrested last Saturday and has been in police custody. On the three farm laws against which thousands of farmers are protesting, Sitharaman said the legislations were brought in by the government after discussions by various parliamentary committees for over a decade.  “When the farm laws were brought in the Lok Sabha, there was an elaborate discussion and the agriculture minister gave his reply as well. It was only when it came to the Rajya Sabha, there was a lot of noise and disturbance,” she added. Sitharamn further said the government has been saying that it is willing to talk with the protesters and has been engaging with them. “The government has asked pointedly what is that one aspect in any one of the three laws which have been passed to which the protesters object,” she said. “We are willing to talk about it, tell us that one particular aspect in any one of the three laws. Till date, we have not had even one particular aspect which is being questioned. And therefore, the protesters are not sure on what score they are protesting, what is it that they are objecting.” (With inputs from PTI) 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

"The Special Investigation Team (SIT) probing the killing of eight people in Lakhimpur Kheri on Tuesday arrested the driver of one of the SUVs that was part of the convoy which ran over a group of protesting farmers on October 3, the police said. While four protesters and allegedly a journalist were run over, three others were killed in the subsequent violence. The accused, Shekhar Bharti, was behind the wheel of one of three vehicles involved in the incident, police said. They said it was owned by Ankit Das, a close aide of Ashish Mishra, Union minister Ajay Mishra’s son, and nephew of former Rajya Sabha MP and UPA minister Akhilesh Das, police said. On Tuesday, the SIT also took custody of Ashish Mishra, who is lodged in Lakhimpur Kheri jail. A local court had on Monday sent Ashish on three-day police custody. In the morning, Ashish was brought to Lakhimpur Kheri Crime Branch office for interrogation. The SIT had decided to “confront” him with witnesses and question him at length on any conspiracy behind the incident. The SIT claims that more people may be called for questioning if they come across any conspiracy during investigation. Besides Ashish, and now Shekhar Bharti, the two others arrested are Luvkush Pandey and Ashish Pandey. “We are yet to ascertain the motive behind the incident,” an officer said. On Sunday, the SIT had arrested Ashish for allegedly not cooperating with the investigation. On Tuesday, defence lawyer Awadesh Kumar Singh said, “Police had allowed us to be present at a distance when the questioning was going on.” Singh also said he had filed a surrender application in a Lakhimpur Kheri court on behalf of Ankit Das, and another driver identified as Lateef. The court had sought a report from local police on the petition, he said. In a release, Lakhimpur Kheri police said Shekhar Bharti, who comes from Lucknow, was produced before a local court, which sent him to judicial custody. Police have sought 14-day custody, and the court will hear that petition on Wednesday, the release stated. According to police, the SIT is trying to collect information on an SUV of Mahindra Scorpio make, which they say was part of the convoy involved in the fatal incident. According to the investigators, a Mahindra Thar vehicle, which belonged to Ajay Mishra, was leading the convoy. It was followed by a black Fortuner and a Scorpio. The Thar and the Fortuner were damaged and set on fire by angry people at the spot after the farmers were run over; those in the Scorpio had sped off, according to police. “We have so far received more than 50 video clips from people, (but) none of them contains the Scorpio’s registration number,” a senior officer associated with the probe said. “One of our major concerns at present is to identify the third vehicle and its occupants. The four people arrested did not give any detail about the Scorpio.”  In a video that emerged on social media last week, a man with injuries on his head is heard claiming that the black Fortuner belonged to Ankit Das. Police are also looking for one Sumit Jaiswal, who is a complainant in one of the two cases lodged at Tikonia police station in connection with the October 3 incident. The agency has decided to record statements of more people present at the spot on October 3 to collect information on the incident and the missing SUV. Police are also trying to trace people injured in the violence and get their statements recorded. Sources said police plan to get a statement of crucial witnesses recorded before a magistrate. 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

"Kickstarting his party’s 2022 election campaign with a “Vijay Rath Yatra” from Kanpur on Tuesday, Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav lashed out at Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, saying that after next year’s state elections both the “Baba Chief Minister” and his “bull and bulldozer” would be swept away. The “bull and bulldozer” remark was a dig at the stray cattle seized by the government and the unauthorised properties it has demolished during its tenure. “Yeh jo sarkar chal rahi hai yeh jo humara Baba Mukhyamantri hain..Yeh jane wale hain, laut ke nahi ane wale…Yeh Baba Mukhyamantri akele nahi jayenge, inke sath bull bhi chala jayega aur bulldozer bhi chala jayega… Jo Baba Mukhyamantri bulldozer leke ghum rahe hain [This government and our ‘Baba chief minister’ are going to go, and he is not going to go alone as the bull and bulldozer with which he roams will also go along with him],” Akhilesh told the gathering at Ghatampur, the first stop of the yatra after it began in Kanpur city. Akhilesh’s estranged uncle Shivpal Singh Yadav also launched his 'Samajik Parivartan Yatra' from Vrindavan on Tuesday — amid confusion whether the two parties will join hands in next year's UP polls. Shivpal had recently said he would wait until October 11 for Akhilesh's response on a tie-up. The former chief minister alleged that the BJP had “crushed farmers” — an apparent reference to the violence in Lakhimpur Kheri on October 3 — and would “crush the Constitution” as well if it returned to power in Uttar Pradesh next year. “Therefore, the Samajwadi Vijay Rath will go to people and throw the BJP out of power. This rath will go on continuously for restoring the rights and honour of farmers,” he said. At the rally, former Congress MP from Akbarpur Raja Ram Pal, who is a former Ghatampur MLA, joined the SP. Targeting the BJP over the Lakhimpur Kheri violence in which at least four farmers and a journalist were mowed down by a convoy of cars, one owned by Union Minister of State for Home Affairs Ajay Mishra, Akhilesh said the ruling party had failed to remove the minister while his son was arrested only because of pressure from Opposition parties. The SP chief claimed his party would ensure justice for farmers. Targeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi without naming him, Akhilesh said despite his and his party’s big claims, neither the Ganga nor its tributaries had been cleaned. Modi had started his 2014 Lok Sabha campaign from Varanasi by seeking the blessings of “Ma Ganga”. Akhilesh said his party would soon release its poll manifesto and announced that his party, if elected to power, would bring back the freebies and social welfare schemes it had in place during its government tenure. Earlier in the day, he flagged off the yatra from the Ganga bridge in Kanpur. 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

"At Tikonia in Lakhimpur Kheri, thousands gathered on Tuesday to pay their last respects to four farmers and a journalist who died on October 3 after a convoy of cars, one owned by Union Minister of State for Home Affairs Ajay Mishra, ploughed through a group of protesting farmers. People, a majority of them Sikhs, came to attend the “antim ardas [final prayers]” for the five men from different districts of Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, and Haryana. The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), which is leading the protest against three Central agrarian laws since last year, had announced the day before that a “Shaheed Kisan Diwas [Martyred Farmers’ Day]” would be observed on Tuesday. Watch: @priyankagandhi attends ‘ardas’ for victims in #LakhimpurKheri Live Updates: https://t.co/g4borJpEwf pic.twitter.com/NkcHig3EEX — The Indian Express (@IndianExpress) October 12, 2021 Prominent leaders such as Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) national spokesperson Rakesh Tikait, and Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) chief Jayant Chaudhary also attended the prayer ceremony and paid their respects to the five. Priyanka did not speak on stage as it was announced that politicians could only pay their respects and would not be allowed to address the gathering. The farmer leaders thanked her and the other politicians for sharing their grief and standing by the families of the victims. On the stage, Priyanka bowed to pay respects to the victims, and then sat among the Congress workers and leaders in the crowd. She was accompanied by state Congress chief Ajay Kumar Lallu and other senior leaders. Swaraj India president Yogendra Yadav also attended the prayer meeting. BKU leader Rakesh Tikait told The Indian Express at the venue, “Our movement will continue. Our movement and protests are ongoing for the last 11 months. We are ready for a long movement till the Union Minister of State is removed. The arrest of Ashish Mishra is political. He has been given a red carpet. Till his father is removed from his post, our protests will go on along with the other protest for the withdrawal of three farm laws. Till his father is removed, the police can’t ensure a fair probe.” Asked about the farmers’ October 4 agreement with the Uttar Pradesh government to call off the protest in Tikunia, he said, “Our agreement was with UP government. They have said that what they promised they have fulfilled. Now, they are saying the rest is up to the Union government. The agreement happened in presence of all senior farmer leaders.” Tikait was the only leader who was allowed to address the gathering from the stage. In his 20-minute address, the BKU leader said, “Everyone has seen what happened. The videos became public late because the internet was shut here..If those videos had not become public, farmers would have been depicted as guilty.” Taking aim at Ajay Mishra, he said, “People have left this area due to fear. He [MoS] is feared by everyone. I met people who were injured. They said their identity should not come out and that they don’t want money. This is the kind of terror here. This movement will continue till the minister resigns, till the minister is sent to jail. He must be sent to Agra jail. He should be remanded by the police. Then, both father and son will tell who are the others in their gang.” Tikait said more than 20 people were injured in the violence but they do not want their identities revealed “due to fear”. He added, “On October 15, effigies will be burnt. It will be decided how to go about it. On October 18, trains will be jammed. The government will continue to level allegations against farmers. We have to keep ourselves safe from them…” Like Priyanka, Jayant Chaudhary too did not address the gathering but paid respects to the victims. At the venue, the RLD chief said farmers were in majority in the state and the country. He added, “Our country’s majority is farmers. Farmers who have died have given a huge sacrifice. Other farmers won’t forget this. We will keep reminding the name of the four farmers who have died and their sacrifice won’t go waste.” The farmers who attended the prayer ceremony had two demands — the removal of Union MoS Ajay Mishra, and his arrest. Mishra’s son Ashish has been arrested in connection with the mowing down of the five men. Several farmer leaders who spoke on stage repeated these demands, and also pointed out that Ajay Mishra, in a speech here on September 25, had talked about “fixing the farm protesters within minutes”. “This is the language of a minister in the Union government. Peaceful protesters are being trampled on and killed by the son of the minister. The whole incident was a conspiracy between the father and the son. The father should also be arrested,” said farmer Mukhtyar Singh (51) from Lakhimpur Kheri’s Palia village who attended the event with four family members.  The prayer meeting was held at a farmland in Tikonia, around a kilometre from where the violence occurred on October 3. Two massive tents were erected and elaborate arrangements were made to ensure a peaceful ceremony. Water bottles, biscuits and food were distributed to those who attended the event. A host of volunteers ensured that people don’t hover around the stage, where family members sat in front of the photographs of the five victims. The “asthi kalash [last remains]” of the five were kept on the stage. Latbeer Singh (47) from Amritsar, Punjab, said the issue at stake was the rights of farmers. “The farmers who gathered at Tikonia on October 3 merely wanted to show black flags to the minister and deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya. This killing is similar to the Jalianwala Bagh massacre. We will only rest after the minister is removed and arrested,” he added. 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

"Lakhimpur Kheri Violence: The SIT probing the Lakhimpur Kheri violence on Thursday took Union Minister Ajay Mishra’s son Ashish Mishra and three others arrested in the case to recreate the sequence of events leading to the incident in Uttar Pradesh’s Tikonia village. Amid tight security, the three accused were taken to the site of the incident on the Tikonia-Banbirpur road, around 60 km from district headquarters Lakhimpur city, police said. Meanwhile, a local court in Lakhimpur Kheri on Wednesday denied bail to Ashish Mishra, the main accused in the murder of four farmers and a journalist who were allegedly run over by a convoy of SUVs, including a Thar jeep owned by his father and Union minister Ajay Mishra. The Special Investigation Team (SIT) of UP Police, meanwhile, arrested two more persons — 38-year-old Ankit Das and 37-year-old Lateef alias Kala — in connection with the incident, taking the total number of arrests in the case to six. Despite his arrest, Ashish, popular as Monu Bhaiyya in Banveerpur — Union minister Ajay Mishra’s village, most villagers vouch for his innocence. According to a villager, Banveerpur fears the Mishra family. “No one will say anything against Ashish or anyone from his family even after he killed four people. Such is their stature in the village,” alleges the 37-year-old farmer.

But the Minister left after visiting the families of two of those killed: BJP worker Shubham Mishra and MoS Ajay Mishra’s driver Hari Om Mishra. He did not meet the families of four others from the area who lost their lives. When contacted by The Indian Express, Pathak said: “I will visit their families of Nishad and Kashyap as soon as the situation normalises in that region as they live close to the spot where the incident took place.” The SIT probing the Lakhimpur Kheri violence on Thursday took Union Minister Ajay Mishra's son and three others arrested in the case to recreate the sequence of events leading to the incident in Uttar Pradesh's Tikonia village.

""This was proved by the fact that the leaders of the opposition parties, who claimed to have gathered a crowd of 50,000, could not mobilise even 1,000 people,"" he said.""Not only this, the opposition unity on the vote bank politics on farmers collapsed when Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, who shed crocodile tears, was not even given a chance to speak from the stage,"" the spokesperson said.

He said that said atrocities being inflicted upon farmers nowadays will not be tolerated at any cost. Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot on Tuesday targeted BJP leaders for comparing a Dalit man's killing in the state's Hanumangarh with the Lakhimpur Kheri violence, saying they are ""foolish"" and lack ""sense"" on how to react to an incident.On October 7, a man was beaten to death in Prempura town of Hanumangarh over his alleged love affair. Police have so far arrested seven people. Gehlot said he himself condemns such incidents and took prompt action, after which the accused were apprehended.When asked that Union Minister of State for Home Ajay Mishra has not been sacked after the Lakhimpur Kheri violence, Gehlot said that's why the Congress is agitating continuously. ""People were killed in broad daylight. We saw people die in riots. We heard that people are killed in police encounters but we haven't seen such deaths. Is the Centre, prime minister or the chief minister not aware about it?"" Gehlot asked. (PTI)  Ashish Mishra at the Crime Branch office in Lakhimpur on Saturday. (Express Photo by Vishal Srivastava) On October 3, a convoy of three vehicles drove through a crowd of protesting farmers in Tikonia, Lakhimpur Kheri district of Uttar Pradesh. One of the cars belonged to Union Minister Ajay Mishra, and his son, Ashish, is alleged to have been behind the wheel. Four farmers were killed in the incident, while four others, including the Minister's driver, two BJP workers and a journalist, died in subsequent protests. While Ajay Mishra has maintained his son was not present at the site of the accident, Ashish was arrested last Saturday and has been in police custody. The police has said he was ""evasive"" during questioning, and sought a 14-day remand. The BJP has rallied behind the Union Minister, while the Opposition has targetted the government for the violence against farmers. The Special Investigation Team (SIT) probing the killing of eight people in Lakhimpur Kheri on Tuesday arrested the driver of one of the SUVs that was part of the convoy which ran over a group of protesting farmers on October 3, the police said. While four protesters and allegedly a journalist were run over, three others were killed in the subsequent violence. The accused, Shekhar Bharti, was behind the wheel of one of three vehicles involved in the incident, police said. They said it was owned by Ankit Das, a close aide of Ashish Mishra, Union minister Ajay Mishra’s son, and nephew of former Rajya Sabha MP and UPA minister Akhilesh Das, police said.",indexp,"Lakhimpur Kheri Violence Live Updates: SIT takes Ashish Mishra, 3 others to recreate sequence of events",N
"Nearly a week after 16 people were arrested in connection with the burning of an effigy of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath in Meerut, Monu Chaudhary and his wife Poonam have been pursuing every lawyer in the district for securing bail for their 18-year-old son Dushyant, a BBA first-year student. On October 4 evening, a group of people was allegedly trying to burn an effigy of the chief minister against the mowing down of four farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri when some policemen tried to take hold of the effigy, and in melee two cops, including a police inspector, sustained burn injuries. All the 16, including some Samajwadi Party members, who were arrested, have been booked for attempt to murder and two more non-bailable sections of the IPC and CrPC. Two more have been named in the FIR but have not been arrested yet. However, the parents of Dushyant Chaudhary said that he and his friend Shekhar Dungar, also a BBA first-year student, were not involved in the protests. “My son and his friend Shekhar Dungar have an acquaintance Pradeep Sardana, who is associated with the Samajwadi Party. Pradeep had called Dushyant and Shekhar around 4.30 pm on October 4 and asked them to arrange food and water for him and others detained by the police. Dushyant and Shekhar rushed to the Civil Lines Police Station with water bottles and a bunch of bananas, but both of them were arrested,” Monu Chaudhary, 42, who runs a small dairy with his wife at Meerut’s Ekta Nagar, said. Arjun Dangar, the father of Shekhar, also said that his son was not involved in the protest. “My 18-year-old son Shekhar was accompanying his friend Dushyant Chaudhary to the Civil Lines police station to give water bottles and fruits to the Samajwadi Party workers who were detained in connection with the protest. But he too was arrested,” said Dangar. Khemchand, who works as a security guard at a private factory, said that his 21-year-old son Dushyant Kumar was not associated with the Samajwadi Party, but was arrested by the police that evening. “My son works in a private factory and has nothing to do with the Samajwadi Party. I was informed about his arrest much later and have not been able to meet my son so far,” said Khemchand. His wife works as domestic help. The police, meanwhile, said that they have evidence against all the 16 people arrested in connection with the protest. “There were 300 protesters at the Commissionary Park on October 4 evening. We detained only 25, and the FIR was lodged against 18. Till now, 16 accused have been arrested, while two are absconding,” SSP (Meerut) Prabhakar Chaudhary told The Indian Express over the phone. “We have minutely gone through the available video footage of the incident and collected forensic evidence before making the arrests. No one has been arrested without proper scrutiny of the available evidence. They were carrying petrol and other inflammable liquids. Two of our policemen have suffered burn injuries during the incident,” the SSP said.  The local chief of the Samajwadi Party’s unit, Rajpal Singh, said that he has been pursuing the administration for the release of the two students — Dushyant and Shekhar. “The burning of the effigy is the simplest form of protest in a democracy. The career of students who have been arrested in this connection stands ruined now. Most of those arrested belong to lower-income groups who cannot even afford the legal expenses involved to ensure a bail for their wards,” said Rajpal Singh. Meanwhile, all the 16 arrested were produced before a court. Sources said that police failed to produce the CD showing the involvement of the accused. The court has fixed October 13 as the next date of hearing in the case. 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

"Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra observed “maun vrat (pledge of silence)” and staged a sit-in here for over three hours on Monday reiterating her party’s demand to sack Union Minister of State for Home Affairs Ajay Mishra. The minister’s son has been arrested for allegedly driving over farmers at a protest in Lakhimpur Kheri on October 3, killing four of them and a journalist. The Congress demonstration came a day after Gandhi addressed a rally in Varanasi in which she called for Mishra’s dismissal and hit out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Even as Priyanka led the protest in Lucknow, her brother and former Congress president Rahul Gandhi alleged that the BJP was obstructing the process of justice by not dismissing Mishra. He alleged that the central government neither cares about farmers nor the BJP workers killed in the violence triggered by the mowing down of the protesters. Priyanka was accompanied by former Congress MPs such as Pramod Tiwari, PL Punia and Zafar Ali Naqvi, and state Congress president Ajay Kumar Lallu at the protest in front of the Mahatma Gandhi statue near the General Post Office. Congress leaders and workers observed similar protests in every Uttar Pradesh district and also other parts of India. Priyanka and the other Congress leaders placed flowers at the statue before starting their silent protest even as the “Raghupati Raghav Raja Ram” bhajan played in the background.

She cited the examples of Hathras and Unnao incidents, the death of a trader in Gorakhpur, and the killing of 11 tribals in Sonbhadra’s Umbha village. “Yogi administration was standing with the accused in all these cases,” she alleged.  Later in the day, the Congress leader tweeted in Hindi, “The son of the minister has been arrested in the case… does the minister still have the right to continue in his post? The dismissal of the Union Minister of State for Home is necessary for a fair investigation…Narendra Modi ji, stop protecting your minister.” Lashing out at the Congress general secretary, Uttar Pradesh Cabinet Minister and government spokesperson Sidhartha Nath Singh said, “We are sending them the good map that will show them the routes to Rajasthan, where recently a Dalit youth was lynched by a mob, and Chhattisgarh, where a farmer was murdered. Maybe you have forgotten the way…That is why I am sending the good maps of both the states.” Meanwhile, Rahul Gandhi tweeted in Hindi along with the hashtag ‘#KisanKoNyayDo, “By not sacking this minister, the BJP is obstructing the process of justice.

The Morcha has appealed to farmers’ organisations across India to organise prayer ceremonies on Tuesday. It also hit out at PM Narendra Modi for “inaction” against Union Minister of State for Home Affairs Ajay Mishra.

The SSS participated in the Maharashtra bandh called by the Maha Vikas Aghadi. Shetti said, “We supported and participated in today’s bandh. We are always in the forefront in the fight for rights of farmers.” The Lakhimpur Kheri incident is shocking, he said. “Union minister Ajay Mishra’s son Ashish runs a jeep over the farmers and crushes them to death. What can be more brutal? What we witness is the governance of terror under BJP rule in the country.” He added, “The farmers were protesting for their rights.

"The statewide bandh called by the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) allies to protest the killing of four farmers in Uttar Pradesh’s Lakhimpur Kheri evoked a mixed response across Maharashtra, with several commercial establishments remaining shut in Mumbai and Pune on Monday. Life was largely unaffected in rural and semi-urban areas of the state. In Mumbai, public transport was also affected as BEST buses as well as autorickshaws and taxis kept off the roads till 4 pm. Traffic on roads was very light. The suburban train services were strained with most office-goers facing difficulties in reaching government and private offices, which were largely unaffected by the bandh call. In Pune, officials said the bandh received a mixed response. While shops in Market Yard and Lakshmi Road were closed in the morning hours, most resumed functioning after 4 pm, they said. Joint commissioner of the Pune city police, Ravindra Shisave, said even though there were protests at certain locations, the law and order situation was peaceful in the city. Shiv Sena unions and cadre ensured commercial establishments complied with the bandh in Mumbai. Some shops opened up late in the evening after the bandh ended at 4 pm. The Navi Mumbai Agricultural Produce Market Committee, meanwhile, kept its operation closed. BEST buses went off the roads early morning after incidents of stone pelting were reported. “A total of 11 BEST buses were damaged by protestors in stone pelting in areas like Dharavi, Mankhurd, Shivaji Nagar, Oshiwara, Deonar, Inorbit mall and Charkop. No bus conductor or driver was hurt. But passengers were on board the buses. We operated 1,833 buses today,” said Manoj Varade, BEST PRO. The Mumbai Police registered at least three FIRs and detained over 200 workers from MVA allies Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP for allegedly blocking roads and damaging BEST buses. They were allowed to go after a few hours. More than 200 people were detained under the Maharashtra Police Act. At Worli naka, Mayor Kishori Pednekar was seen protesting on the footpath with Sena workers. Meanwhile, the Pune BJP unit condemned the protest, alleging in a press note that the “concern for farmers” was “fake”.

"Gujarat Congress leaders staged a silent protest (maun dharna) in Ahmedabad Monday demanding the resignation of Minister of State (MoS) Home Affairs Ajay Kumar Mishra over the deaths of eight persons in Lakhimpur Kheri, including four farmers who were mowed down by a convoy of vehicles including one owned by Mishra. Several senior leaders including All India Congress Committee (AICC) incharge of Gujarat Raghu Sharma, Gujarat Pradesh Congress Committee (GPCC) president Amit Chavda, GPCC working president Hardik Patel, Leader of Opposition Paresh Dhanani, Vadgam MLA Jignesh Mevani were part of the protest outside Kochrab Ashram. The Congress leaders demanded the immediate resignation of Mishra over the death of farmers and also the murder of a journalist and three BJP workers. UP Police have filed an FIR for murder against Ashish Mishra, the Minister’s son who is alleged to have been driving one of the vehicles, and arrested him. Raghu Sharma alleged that the police are “treating Congress leaders as criminals” and “writing love letters to the accused asking them suitable time for an appointment for investigation”.  “The manner in which son of Home Minister Ajay Mishra mowed down farmers and killed them in a horrific manner, it is very surprising that they (accused) left for Delhi after the incident whereas our leader Priyanka Gandhi was illegally detained for three days by UP police without any reason and stopped from visiting Lakhimpur Kheri. Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi, Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel and Punjab CM Charanjit Singh Channi tried to visit the grieving families but they were also stopped at the airport,” said Sharma adding that the party demands compensation for the victims. “Today we staged a silent protest against the BJP government that is bent on destroying democracy and also against the barbaric acts of the son of Ajay Mishra,” Chavda said. 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

"Leader of Opposition in the state Assembly, Devendra Fadnavis, described the Maharashtra bandh called by the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government on Monday to protest against the killing of four farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri on October 3 as a political stunt. “If the government is seriously concerned about farmers’ welfare, it should first announce a decent package for flood-hit Vidarbha and Marathwada farmers before calling a Maharashtra bandh,” Fadnavis told mediapersons. “Action will be taken in connection to the Lakhimpur Kheri incident in Uttar Pradesh. Even the Supreme Court is monitoring the incident. The Uttar Pradesh government is also taking action. However, what has the MVA government done for the farmers of Maharashtra?” “At least 2,000 farmers have committed suicide in Maharashtra during 15 months of MVA rule. They have neither received benefits of loan waiver nor given help by the administration,” he added. He alleged that the state government has misused police and administration to enforce the bandh against public will. On NCP president Sharad Pawar equating the Lakhimpur Kheri killings to Jallianwala Bagh massacre, Fadnavis said, “During the Congress-NCP regime, innocent farmers were fired upon at Maval in Pune. In Rajasthan, the Congress government used police to beat up farmers. At that time, they did not draw parallel with Jallianwala Bagh.”  “All work and establishments were closed due to Covid-19 lockdown. After a long period, the situation is coming back to normal. But the government thrust the bandh on the people,” he said while terming MVA as a “bandh sarkar”. State BJP president Chandrakant Patil said, “The NCP called a state bandh to divert people’s attention from raids carried out against its leaders and their families for the last 15 days by the income tax department.” The I-T department had last week raided various establishments associated with Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar and his sisters.

On whether politicians will be part of the prayers, BKU-Tikait district vice-president Balkar Singh said, “No political leader will be allowed to share the stage where only Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) leaders will be present.” Sukhdev Singh, the uncle of the dead farmer Gurvinder Singh, a resident of Moharnia village under the Matera police station of Bahraich, told PTI that a “bhog” was held at the houses of Gurvinder Singh and Daljit Singh of Banjaran Tada, who had died during the October 3 violence. A separate “paath” has been kept for the dead farmers at the Kaudiyala Ghat gurdwara, which will be followed by a collective “antim ardas” and “langar” on Tuesday, he said.

"With Union MoS Ajay Mishra’s son remanded in police custody over the Lakhimpur Kheri incident for which he is facing murder charges, the BJP is rallying behind the Minister with senior leaders pointing out that he has denied his son’s involvement and that UP Police have not found any evidence to indicate otherwise. With Opposition parties stepping up their demand for Mishra’s resignation, BJP sources told The Indian Express that the party is awaiting progress on the police investigation. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will take a call once the police complete their probe, they said. On Monday, Ajay Mishra’s son Ashish Mishra was remanded in police custody for three days by a court in Lakhimpur Kheri over the incident on October 3 when a convoy of vehicles, including one owned by the Minister, hit a group of farm protesters, killing four farmers. One of the protesters has alleged in a complaint to police, based on which an FIR was registered, that Ashish Mishra was driving one of the vehicles. “If there is evidence that shows his involvement in the incident, the top leadership will take a decision. The party will not come under pressure just because Opposition parties are demanding his resignation,” said a senior BJP functionary. Sources said the party has assessed that the incident is not likely to have a major impact on its prospects in the UP assembly elections early next year. “However, the party’s final decision will be taken on the basis of the progress of the investigation,” said a leader. In court Monday, UP Police’s Special Investigation Team (SIT) in the Lakhimpur Kheri case sought custody of Ashish Mishra for 14 days after arresting him late Saturday for “not cooperating with the probe”. Sources told The Indian Express that the SIT had prepared a “long questionnaire” for Ashish but “he did not respond to most of the questions”. “Ashish Mishra gave replies to about 40 questions during 12 hours of questioning on Sunday,” said a state government official. Sources said the SIT will “confront” him with witnesses and question him on allegations of criminal conspiracy. The SIT also wants to ascertain the identity of all those who were in the three vehicles that hit the protesters, they said. In the violence that followed the incident, the Minister’s driver and two BJP workers were killed. A journalist was also among those who died. A senior officer said police personnel present in the area are being questioned. On Monday, the court proceedings were conducted over videoconference, with the police saying that they needed custody to collect evidence and interrogate the accused further. “After hearing both sides, the Chief Judicial Magistrate ordered Ashish Mishra to be sent for three days’ police custody remand. The court has allowed lawyers of the accused to watch the process (interrogation) from a distance so that no disturbance is caused,” Prosecuting Officer S P Yadav said. “Police sought custody on the ground that my client was not cooperating in the probe. We objected because the agency did not produce any evidence against my client,” defence counsel Awadesh Kumar Singh said. In Delhi, Union Home Minister Amit Shah met Union Minister for Law and Justice Kiren Rijijju and Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister P K Mishra in North Block. BJP leaders, however, denied suggestions that the meeting was held to discuss the Lakhimpur Kheri incident.  The Congress, meanwhile, staged “silent sit-in” protests and demonstrations demanding the resignation of Ajay Mishra. CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury also sought the removal of Mishra from the Government, saying “justice will not be served with his continuation as minister”. As for the elections, senior leaders of the BJP in UP met national leaders in charge of the state to discuss strategy. Sources said the party will first focus on 100 constituencies where it had either lost earlier or has been losing ground. Monday’s meeting also finalised the BJP’s campaign for the next 100 days, including 100 programmes in these constituencies at the booth and mandal levels. The meeting was held by party chief J P Nadda and national general secretary (organisation) B L Santhosh. It was attended by Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, the election in-charge; former Union minister Radha Mohan Singh, the state in-charge; Swatantra Dev Singh, BJP’s UP chief; and Sunil Bansal, general secretary (organisation, UP). 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

"Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on Monday said the Maharashtra government is fighting for the rights of the farmers across the country and that the statewide bandh today is organised to protest the atrocities against them. The three allies – Shiv Sena, NCP, and Congress – in the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in Maharashtra have called for a bandh today to express solidarity with farmers in Uttar Pradesh. “Today’s bandh is to protest the Lakhimpur Kheri incident where innocent farmers were killed by those enjoying political power,” Raut said, speaking to media outside his residence in Mumbai. “The bandh call has elicited good response from people across the state. Farmers across the country are looking at Maharashtra which has always fought for their rights. The ill-treatment meted to farmers is no secret. For several months, farmers have been protesting in the outskirts of Delhi. Instead of listening to them, those in power have tried to inflict atrocities on them. Farmers were beaten and killed in Haryana which is BJP ruled state. Now, we have seen how inhumanely farmers were killed in Uttar Pradesh, which is also ruled by BJP,” Raut said. On reports of stone-pelting in some places in the state, Raut said, “When you hold demonstrations some untoward incidents like stone-pelting on buses, etc takes place. This has been the phenomenon across the world.” Bus services of the Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) were closed after nine buses, including one hired on lease, were damaged. As the BEST buses and many of the traditional ‘black-yellow cabs’ remained off roads, there were huge crowds on suburban railway stations to commute by local trains, which were running as per schedule.    Commenting on BJPs traders association protest and some leaders threatening to foil the bandh, Raut said, ” I dare them to come out in street and declare their stand. If anybody tries to counter the band they will face the ramifications.” “From what we noticed the bandh is a success. Maharashtra has given a loud message — atrocities against farmers will not be tolerated,” Raut added.
