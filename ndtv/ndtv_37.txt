He had skipped the summons yesterday due to health reasons, according to his father.His arrest came five days after he was named in a murder case. The charges against him would usually merit an immediate arrest and questions have been raised about whether he was afforded VIP treatment because of his father.Eight people, including four farmers, died in the UP district on October 3 after a car ran over a group of demonstrators protesting against the visit by junior Home Minister Ajay Mishra and UP's Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya. Though the Union Minister admits the SUV that ran over farmers belongs to him, he maintains his son was not in it.The farmer said that the incident was a "pre-planned conspiracy".
