Manjit Singh Rai, president of Bhartiya Kisan Union, Doaba, told NDTV yesterday that 32 farmers' unions are on the same page on the issue and they also want a public apology from Mr Yadav.Four farmers were run over in Lakhimpur Kheri, allegedly by Ashish Mishra, the son of Union minister Ajay Mishra, during a protest earlier this month. Violence and arson broke out soon after, in which four others were killed.Ashish Mishra was arrested on October 9, five days after he was named in a murder case. Four more people have been arrested in connection with the case.PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com
