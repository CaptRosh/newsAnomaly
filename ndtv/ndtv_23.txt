This incident is a blot on humanity," Mr Singh, BJP state executive member, told reporters."His son crushed farmers to death under his car. He was arrested after the intervention of the Supreme Court, but even today the minister is sitting on the chair. In such a situation, Prime Minister Narendra Modi should sack him immediately," he said.In response to a question, Singh said that the image of the BJP government has been "tarnished" by the Lakhimpur incident and the Gorakhpur businessman murder case.He said that BJP workers have also been killed in the Lakhimpur incident and the government should also take care of them."Activists across the state are angry due to the callousness of the government on this incident.
