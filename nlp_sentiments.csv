(File)Srinagar: Union Home Minister Amit Shah has hit out at National Conference president Farooq Abdullah for seeking talks with Pakistan, saying the government would rather talk to the youth of Jammu and Kashmir for making it the most developed in the country.The home minister, who is on a visit to Jammu and Kashmir -- his first since the abrogation of Article 370 in August 2019 -- remotely inaugurated several development projects and laid the foundation stone of some.""I read in newspapers that Farooq Abdullah has suggested that the government should talk to Pakistan. He has a right to his opinion but we would rather talk to the Kashmiri youth,"" Mr Shah said while addressing a function at the SKICC.""The repealing of Article 370 had only one intention -- to put Kashmir, Jammu and newly created Ladakh (Union Territory) on the path of development. You will see the fruits of our efforts by 2024,"" he said.The article, which granted special status to the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir, was abrogated in August 2019 and the state was bifurcated into union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh.Mr Shah inaugurated a 500-bed hospital at Bemina, completed at a cost of Rs 115 crore, laid the foundation stone for the Handwara Medical College, a Rs 46-crore steel girder bridge over the Ferozepur Nallah in Baramulla district and road projects worth Rs 4,000 crore, among others.The home minister, who is on his Jammu and Kashmir visit's third day, said that those who advocate talks with Islamabad and separatists should be asked what has Pakistan done in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).""Compare the development between this side and PoK. Do they have electricity, roads, healthcare and toilets. There is nothing (on the other side). You (Kashmiris) have the same rights as any other Indian,"" he said.Without naming the Congress, the National Conference and the Peoples' Democratic Party, he said while only three medical colleges were set up by the ""three families which have ruled Jammu and Kashmir"", Prime Minister Narendra Modi has ensured seven new medical colleges and these are coming up.""Earlier, 500 youths could become doctors... now 2,000 youths can become doctors from these new medical colleges. Nobody will need to go to Pakistan to study medicine,"" he said.Mr Shah said the schemes and the plans of the Modi government will ensure that Jammu and Kashmir will be the most developed province of the country.He sought the cooperation of the people to realise this dream. ""It is only the youth of Jammu and Kashmir who can work towards achieving this goal,"" he said.Asserting that the government is aiming to wipe out terrorism from Jammu and Kashmir and put an end to civilian killings, Shah said nobody would be allowed to disrupt peace and development in the Union Territory, which has a special place in Prime Minister Modi's heart.Defending the curbs on internet services and imposition of curfew in the aftermath of abrogation of Article 370, he said that ""some people would have misled the masses. Who would have been killed? The Kashmiri youth. We know how heavy the coffin of a young son is for an old man"".He said that 40,000 people have been killed in Kashmir in violence and it should stop now.""This many people do not die even in wars. We have to come back and take Kashmir to new heights of development,"" he said.The minister said Rs 12,000 crore worth of investment has already come to the Union Territory and the government aims at a total of Rs 51,000 crore by the end of 2022 to provide five lakh jobs to the local youth.Mr Shah said ""three families"" are answerable to the people for their failure to develop Jammu and Kashmir over the past seven decades.""The new phase of development under the leadership of Modi has started in J&K but attempts are being made by inimical elements to create hurdles. I have come here to assure you that nobody will be able to create a hurdle and disrupt peace and development,"" Amit Shah said.He said a new phase of development has started and this cannot be stopped by anyone.Listing various steps taken by the government since the formation of the BJP government at the Centre, Mr Shah said five lakh jobs are being created in Jammu and Kashmir, while 20,000 people have been provided government jobs in the past two years.""The three families used to say who will come and invest in J&K.... in just six months after announcing a new industrial policy, we have got an investment of Rs 7,000 crore in Jammu and Rs 6,000 crore in Kashmir and are looking forward to an investment of Rs 50,000 crore by the end of 2022,"" the minister said.Targeting the ""three families"", he said they were asking what the government is going to give to Jammu and Kashmir.PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com""We have a long list of what we have given to J&K and the people know it very well but the people are demanding an answer from them as to what they have given to J&K despite ruling the erstwhile state for the past seven decades.

Further, in the first nine months of this year, there were 63 cases of terrorist-initiated encounters and 28 instances of atrocities committed by terrorists were registered.A ministry official told NDTV: ""The narrative of the centre is that J&K is safe for everyone… but these killings prove minorities and outsiders are not safe. This is a big concern for government… so a strategy to further reassure people was discussed"".The threat of radicalisation - high on the list of the government's concerns for J&K - is something that has been flagged by all intelligence and security agencies operating in the Kashmir Valley.Government data says 97 youngsters (local residents) had left their homes to join terror outfits; 56 have been 'neutralised'. A number of pistol-related shootings indicate they are turning violent, an on-ground officer explains.Last year's numbers were higher - 178 joined terror outfits and 121 were 'neutralised'.Nevertheless, the government's strategy to counter the narrative of pro-Pakistan voices is not working - this is after various raids and arrests by the NIA, or National Investigation Agency.#WATCH Union Home Minister Amit Shah chairs security review meeting during his three-day visit to the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir pic.twitter.com/qtohyuXs2P— ANI (@ANI) October 23, 2021Mr Shah has also sought explanations on prolonged encounters and anti-terror ops.This comes as the Army and security forces are engaged in a 13-day anti-terror op - the longest and fiercest in recent times, which has seen the death of nine soldiers. Army and police sources have said the fighting has led to speculation the terrorists may have been trained by Pak commandos.Data shows that only 14 infiltration bids were successful this year but the number of encounters (even around Srinagar city) have gone up.

28,"""Anyone Not Speaking Against This..."": Army Officer Over Civilian Killings In J&K","The officer said there's a need to understand the psychology of younger population.(Representational)Srinagar: Amid a spate of targeted killings by terrorists, a senior army officer has said the time has come for some sections in Kashmir to overcome ""selective dementia"" and condemn the killing of civilians so that future generations are saved and there is an end to people's sufferings.Lt Gen K JS Dhillon, Director General of Defence Intelligence Agency and Deputy Chief of Integrated Defence Staff, said the perpetrators of such attacks on innocent civilians are targeting the roots of the society and that such people can never be friends of Kashmir.Addressing a seminar on Wednesday, Lt Gen Dhillon said, ""Over the past three decades, the Kashmiri society suffered and the very base and root of Kashmir suffered.... We have the right to (have own) feelings but whenever there is a killing by terrorists, selective dementia happens.""""Anyone not speaking against this (killing of innocents), that man or woman has lost the right to speak about everything else. The world would later ask when you were silent on innocent killings, why should you be heard now,"" he said and urged people to overcome the syndrome of ""selective dementia"".Lt Gen Dhillon, who was also heading the strategic Kashmir-based XV Corps of the army during the crucial phase of abrogation of Article 370, highlighted that 66 per cent of the population of Kashmir is below 32 years of age and they could be referred to as ""children of conflict"" and ""we need to understand their psychology"".He said there is a need to understand the psychology of the younger population and the pain of the mothers.""The 2011 census puts the population of Kashmir below 32 years of age at 62 per cent and today it would have been around 66 per cent, which means that 66 per cent of the population were born during these three decades (of militancy) and are the children of conflict.""They were born and brought up during the gun culture, strikes, curfews and crackdowns. They have grown up with a scar on their psychology. They have grown through radicalization and propaganda...so there is a problem and we need to understand their psychology,"" he said.""Who's to be blamed and who is the loser? The loser is a Kashmiri wife, loser is a Kashmiri mother...Kashmiri mother because her child could not go to proper school, did not get proper education, whose child was pushed into madrassa and was indoctrinated, joined the rank and file of a terror group and lost his life within a day or a year, leaving her grieving for the entire life.""The grief of that mother stems from the rot of terrorism and we need to address it as a society,"" said Lt Gen Dhillon, who during his tenure had initiated ""Operation Maa"" to educate mothers about the ills of terrorism and prevent their children from joining terror groups.Citing an instance during security checks at airports abroad, Lt Gen Dhillon said that ""calling someone Paki (Pakistani) in the western world is an abuse and do you (Kashmiris) want to be a society like that.""""Are we heading that way? We have a rich history of 5000-plus years which is peaceful, based on coexistence, Kashmiriyat, insaniyat and Sufiyat,"" he said.He said the economic side of the recent killing of innocents by terrorists was to trigger panic to prompt prospective tourists to cancel hotel bookings so that common people suffer and become fodder for their terror groups.""The mainstay of young Kashmiri is tourism, it may be yatra (pilgrimage), trekking, skiing in Gulmarg...the tourists come and contribute to the economy, whether in Indian or foreign currency. If peace is not there, who will come? We have seen seasons in the past when there were no tourists and the local people suffered,"" Lt Gen Dhillon said.""We need to understand that we are being attacked at the very root -- be it education, business, livelihood -- and those doing it cannot be a friend of mine. This has to be understood by a common Kashmiri,"" said Lt Gen Dhillon, who served as a captain in north Kashmir during 1990 and went on to head the XV Corps overlooking security along the Line of Control as well as hinterland.Referring to the period he was posted as a captain in north Kashmir's Kupwara district in January 1990 when Pakistan-sponsored terrorism erupted in the valley, he said the percentage of the people affected by it and those involved in it were both in single digits, but 80 to 90 per cent of the population remained silent to the happenings.""Kashmiri Pandits were made to leave Kashmir. It is not just Kashmiri Pandits, but a part of the soul of Kashmir left. Kashmiri Pandits were the mainstay of the education system in the valley. What happened in 1989-90 when terrorism started, the first casualties were the schools that have been burnt down,"" he said.He said the people who were doing this did not want an education system in the Kashmiri society and wanted to crush the spirit of ""Kashmiriyat"".He also added that terrorists ensured that Jammu and Kashmir lacked behind the rest of the country and the main reason for it was the eruption of militancy in the erstwhile state.""When the benefits of global economy accrued and India started getting its benefits, it was the same time when terrorism started in the valley in 1990 as a result Jammu and Kashmir lost this opportunity to be part of the global economy and avail its benefits,"" he said.PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.comKashmir has witnessed a spate of targeted civilian killings in the past few weeks.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",0,0,officer said need understand psychology younger population representational srinagar amid spate targeted killing terrorist senior army officer said time come section kashmir overcome selective dementia condemn killing civilian future generation saved end people suffering lt gen dhillon director general defence intelligence agency deputy chief integrated defence staff said perpetrator attack innocent civilian targeting root society people friend kashmir addressing seminar wednesday lt gen dhillon said past decade kashmiri society suffered base root kashmir suffered right feeling killing terrorist selective dementia happens speaking killing innocent man woman lost right speak world later ask silent innocent killing heard said urged people overcome syndrome selective dementia lt gen dhillon heading strategic kashmir based xv corp army crucial phase abrogation article highlighted cent population kashmir year age referred child conflict need understand psychology said need understand psychology younger population pain mother census put population kashmir year age cent today cent mean cent population born decade militancy child conflict born brought gun culture strike curfew crackdown grown scar psychology grown radicalization propaganda problem need understand psychology said blamed loser loser kashmiri wife loser kashmiri mother kashmiri mother child proper school did proper education child pushed madrassa indoctrinated joined rank file terror group lost life day year leaving grieving entire life grief mother stem rot terrorism need address society said lt gen dhillon tenure initiated operation maa educate mother ill terrorism prevent child joining terror group citing instance security check airport abroad lt gen dhillon said calling paki pakistani western world abuse kashmiri want society like heading way rich history plus year peaceful based coexistence kashmiriyat insaniyat sufiyat said said economic recent killing innocent terrorist trigger panic prompt prospective tourist cancel hotel booking common people suffer fodder terror group mainstay young kashmiri tourism yatra pilgrimage trekking skiing gulmarg tourist come contribute economy indian foreign currency peace come seen season past tourist local people suffered lt gen dhillon said need understand attacked root education business livelihood doing friend understood common kashmiri said lt gen dhillon served captain north kashmir went head xv corp overlooking security line control hinterland referring period posted captain north kashmir kupwara district january pakistan sponsored terrorism erupted valley said percentage people affected involved single digit cent population remained silent happening kashmiri pandits leave kashmir just kashmiri pandits soul kashmir left kashmiri pandits mainstay education valley happened terrorism started casualty school burnt said said people doing did want education kashmiri society wanted crush spirit kashmiriyat added terrorist ensured jammu kashmir lacked rest country main reason eruption militancy erstwhile state benefit global economy accrued india started getting benefit time terrorism started valley result jammu kashmir lost opportunity global economy avail benefit said promotedlisten latest song jiosaavn comkashmir witnessed spate targeted civilian killing past week headline story edited ndtv staff published syndicated feed,-0.999,0.102,0.613,0.285,0.0,1

32,"Petrol and diesel prices unchanged for 26th straight day, here’s what it costs in your city today","Petrol and diesel price today: Petrol and diesel prices continued to remain unchanged across the country for the 26th straight day on Wednesday, August 11, 2021. Petrol was last revised when it had touched a fresh record highs on July 17, when it rose by 30 paise per litre in the national capital while diesel prices were kept unchanged. The price of petrol in Delhi stands at Rs 101.84 per litre while that of diesel is at Rs 89.87. In Mumbai, petrol currently costs Rs 107.83, while diesel is retailing at Rs 97.45, data available on Indian Oil Corporation’s website showed. There has been no change in fuel prices so far in August. In July, petrol prices were hiked nine times while diesel rates were raised on five occasions and cut on one occasion. In June, both the auto fuel prices were hiked on 16 occasions, which followed the 16 hikes in the month of May after the oil marketing companies (OMCs) resumed their price revisions ending an 18-day hiatus that coincided with the assembly elections in key states. During this period, petrol price has increased by Rs 11.44 per litre and diesel has climbed by Rs 9.14 in New Delhi. Following the hikes since May 4, the price of petrol crossed the Rs 100-per-litre mark across many places in at least 19 states and union territories including Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Ladakh, Karnataka, Jammu and Kashmir (J&K), Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Bihar, Kerala, Punjab, Sikkim, Puducherry, Delhi and West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. Auto fuel prices in the country differ from state to state depending on the local taxation (VAT) and freight charges. Apart from this, the central government charges an excise duty on auto fuels. OMCs revise rates of petrol and diesel daily based on the average price of benchmark fuel in the international market in the preceding 15-days and foreign exchange rates. In the international market, oil prices slipped on Thursday following two days of gains after a call from the United States, the world’s top oil consumer, for major producers to boost output reinforced supply concerns as economies ease their coronavirus restrictions, news agency Reuters reported.  Brent crude futures slipped by 17 cents (0.2 per cent) to $71.27 a barrel by 0650 GMT, after earlier rising to a session-high of $71.69. US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures fell by 23 cents (0.3 per cent) to $69.02 after rising to $69.51 earlier, the report said.   📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

33,"‘Have no links with militant groups, do not believe in agitational politics’: Jamaat-e-Islami on NIA raids at its premises in J&K","Distancing itself from the “terror-financing allegations” over which dozens of its premises in Jammu and Kashmir were raided by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) last week, the three former chiefs of Jamaat-e-Islami have said that the organisation “has no direct or tacit link with any militant group”. This is the first time that the Jamaat has issued a statement since being banned in February 2019. “Jamaat has time and again made it quite clear that it had no direct or tacit touch or link with any militant group and all such allegations against Jamaat were false… Jamaat never believed in agitational politics and had never employed any such methods which might cause any least disturbance in the law-and-order situation or any kind of strife on the earth,” the press statement issued jointly by Sheikh Ghilam Hassan, Ghulam Mohammad Bhat and Mohammad Abdullah Wani read. It added, “Jamaat always employed propagatory methods, verbal as well as written, to carry forward its mission, programmes and policies which were beneficial for the entire human society. But despite this fact, it was banned and declared as an ‘unlawful association’ a number of times without any rhyme or reason, levelling such allegations which had no basis but were all against the facts, in total ignorance of the real situation.” The statement further said that the “public services of the organisation were ignored” while banning the outfit on some “flimsy and concocted allegations”. Making a reference to the 1998 press conference of the then Jamaat chief Ghulam Mohammad Bhat where he had categorically distanced the organisation from any militant organisation, the statement said that Jamat is a “peaceful, democratic and transparent” organisation. “Jamat was made for propagating Islamic teachings among the public in its pristine form and for the social services of the humanity without any discrimination,” the statement said, while adding, “(Jamat was made) in particular to provide material assistance to the economically and educationally downtrodden section of the general public from its lawfully created resources.” Distancing Jamat from separatist politics, the three former Chiefs have said that the organisation is not a constituent of the separatist conglomerate Hurriyat Conference for a long time.  “Jamaat had dissociated from the Hurriyat Conference (both factions) in 2008 and as such doesn’t remain a unit of any of these factions therefrom. It is hereby further cleared that Jamaat was neither a creation of any political issue nor had so far created such an issue. If there was any such public political issue, Jamaat too was affected only because of being a part of the public at large.” The statement read. The three former Chiefs also called for the lifting of the ban. “It is hoped that the ban on it will be lifted forthwith thereby allowing this human-friendly socio-religious organisation to work freely for the cause of humanity,” the statement added. 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

34,"Shershaah review: Sidharth Malhotra starrer needed to soar, for yeh dil maange more","Shershaah movie cast: Sidharth Malhotra, Kiara Advani, Shiv Panditt, Sahil Vaid, Nikitin Dheer
Shershaah movie director: Vishnu Vardhan
Shershaah movie rating: 2 stars Going by the real-life story of Captain Vikram Batra whose extraordinary courage in the face of certain death made him one of the shining stars of the Kargil conflict, his biopic should have been all this, and more. Sadly, ‘Shershaah’ has neither the necessary drama inherent in a cracking war film, nor does it raise patriotic goosebumps. It begins with a battle, which we gather soon enough is to capture one of the crucial bunkers high up on a border peak, which has been taken by Pakistani forces. Bullets are flying, soldiers are pointing and shooting and dodging enemy fire, grenades are being lobbed, flesh is being rent. By rights, we should have had our hearts in our mouths, but the adrenalin doesn’t pump enough. This pretty much sets the tone for the rest of the film, a flashback, showing us Vikram (Sidharth Malhotra) as a feisty boy, already clear about his intention to join the ‘fauj’. Everything after is by the numbers: first posting (our man feels it necessary to declare it out loud, when it’s amply clear he has just arrived on the base), encounters with terrorists in Jammu & Kashmir where he first starts to earn plaudits, pining for his lady love (Kiara Advani), the declaration of ‘war’, and the final summit. It’s isn’t as if Bollywood is a dab hand at war movies. Bunging in lashes of jingoism and chest-thumping and loud battle-cries has been considered enough in most instances: on that score, ‘Shershaah’ displays restraint, even if there’s a line somewhere which has been translated (in the subtitles) as ‘castrated goat’, which is flung at an enemy soldier. There is a patent sincerity about the enterprise, even though it’s quite clear that ‘Shershaah’ is also jumping on the let’s-be-nationalistic bandwagon. What’s also nice is the home scenes involving Vikram and his nice middle-class Palampur family (he calls himself, helpfully, a ‘Palampur ka launda’ twice, just in case we missed it) but you cannot help noticing just how staid everything is, even the romance with pretty Chandigarh ‘sikhni’ Dimple. How do you exchange full sentences when there’s a war going on? I didn’t feel the urgency, the sense of imminent danger, nor impending doom. Yes, you do hear the actual slogans. Vikram Batra, played staidly by Sidharth Malhotra, tells his commanding officer he has won the first round with the code word, ‘yeh dil maange more’. It was in the second, climatic attack where he managed to kill a bunch of Pakistani soldiers single-handedly, save a compatriot’s life, and destroy a machine gun nest. This tale needed to soar, and Shershaah needed to roar. Yes, my dil wanted more. 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

35,Delhi confidential: Noose Protest,"TRINAMOOL CONGRESS managed to grab quite some attention with its protests in Rajya Sabha this session. And Wednesday was no different, with its MP Shanta Chhetri wearing a noose around her neck through the entire protest. While Chhetri wore the noose, fellow party MP Dola Sen held the rope as they joined other members to protest against, what they called, the “murder of democracy” by Treasury benches. Even after the House was adjourned, Chhetri kept wearing the noose as she came out to the lobby. “Abhi main ye nikal loon,” she asked party colleagues in the lobby, triggering a round of laughter among other opposition MPs standing in the lobby. They told her she can take it off since the House was adjourned. Hitting The Road  WITH THE BJP planning a Jan Ashirwad Yatra across 22 states for 39 Union ministers, a visit home for many of the new ministers will have to wait. Several of them have to been able to visit their native places since becoming ministers as the Monsoon Session got underway immediately. And then the party decided that they would head straight for these yatras. According to BJP general secretary in charge of the programme, Tarun Chugh, the shortest yatra would be of three days and some would have to travel for seven straight days. It will span 142 working days, he said. “Since one minister [Bishweswar Tudu from Odisha] is unwell, the remaining 39 ministers from 19 states will cover 19,567 km across 22 states,” Chugh said. Heading North  NOW THAT the Monsoon Session is over, it appears that most MPs will be heading for Jammu and Kashmir. More than 200 MPs are expected to visit J&K within a month, as part of eight standing committees which will be heading there. The Public Accounts Committee will visit next week (August 14-17), followed by the Committee on Urban Development. Then the committees on Home, Energy, Labour, Railways, External Affairs and Commerce are expected to visit J&K before the end of September, sources said. 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

36,"Spy vs Spy: ISI knew Kulbushan Jadhav was ‘small fry’, waited before snaring him, says new book","🔴Pakistan’s Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) knew Kulbushan Jadhav was “small fry” but waited to “manufacture a big, fat Indian catch”. 🔴Indian intelligence agencies infiltrated Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Wani’s circles and waited for foreign militants to join him. 🔴On the 26/11 attack, foreign agencies sent 18 detailed briefs, including likely targets in Mumbai, the number of attackers, their route, and method — but all this intelligence was “largely ignored”. These are some of the claims in Spy Stories: Inside the Secret World of the RAW and the ISI, journalist couple Adrian Levy and Cathy Scott-Clark’s latest book, published by Juggernaut, on the alleged secret dealings of Indian and Pakistani intelligence agencies. While the authors have pieced together the anecdotes in the book from talking to several high-profile serving and retired spies, their main sources are two lesser-known, mid-level ex-officers, one in the ISI and the other R&AW. The ISI officer, identified by his nom de guerre ‘Major Iftikhar’, is supposed to have taken part in several ISI operations, including in Kashmir, before going rogue. The former R&AW officer, identified as ‘Monisha’, too got disillusioned by the agency she served and is now settled in the US, the authors write. On Jadhav — who was arrested in Balochistan in 2016 on charges of being an Indian spy and who has been languishing in a Pakistan jail since then — the authors write that ISI used the network of Uzair Baloch, a Karachi-based “landlord, trader, thug, local hero, robber, and philanthropist” with “deep connections into Iranian Baluchistan”, to spy in the Iranian port city of Chabahar. Sometime in 2014, in a compound in Chabahar, the ISI “identified men they believed to be RAW officers and they puzzled over one repeat visitor they did not know… He was not an Iranian. But he appeared to be running a marine freight business from there,” the book quotes an ISI officer. The authors quote an unnamed colonel in the external intelligence wing of ISI as saying, “The ISI waited patiently, hoping to grow Jadhav into something special and then when he was big enough, as a target, ISI would pull him in”. The book says Jadhav was outraged by the Parliament attack of 2001 and offered to assist Indian agencies. Four years after 26/11, Jadhav reported something that was too good to be true. “He told the people he was speaking to that he had managed to work his way into the Baloch family of Lyari. His contact was a nephew of Uzair Baloch,” says the book. Jadhav had thus “been ensnared by the ISI which had been dangling the Baloch family, hoping he would bite… The game was on… a Karachi crime family serving ISI to buy their freedom; the ISI that wanted to manufacture a big, fat Indian catch”. On Kashmiri militant and Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Wani, whose killing in 2016 set off protests across the Valley, Levy and Scott-Clark say he could have been killed earlier, but Indian agencies had infiltrated his internal circle, and kept him under constant surveillance, using him to trap foreign militants. “More people of every kind wanted in. Veterans risked the LoC crossing into India, without knowing that the NTRO and RAW were constantly monitoring them, Burhan Wani acting like flypaper for the Indian intelligence community,” they write. Wani was shot dead on July 8, 2016, in a village named Bamdora, where he was hiding with some accomplices. “Outside the Valley, in New Delhi, something had shifted,” the journalists say. On the 26/11 terrorist attacks in Mumbai, the authors say what “unfolded on 26/11 was so close to the intelligence excavated by Western agencies”, who had an undeclared, high value source in David Headley, the Pakistani-American Lashkar terrorist who is serving a prison sentence in the US.  Indian agencies had been told by the US to safeguard the targets — intelligence that went “largely ignored”. The book quotes Monisha as saying, “I was unable to get traction in Lodhi Road [R&AW]… What mattered was whether India bothered to develop the intelligence from GCHQ and the NSA before the raid. Or did we fail, through laziness, or – worse still – by intent?” 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

37,"Petrol and diesel prices in your city today, check here","Petrol and diesel price today: Petrol and diesel prices continued to remain steady across the country for the 25th straight day on Wednesday, August 11, 2021. Petrol was last revised when it had touched a fresh record highs on July 17, when it rose by 30 paise per litre in the national capital while diesel prices were kept unchanged. The price of petrol in Delhi stands at Rs 101.84 per litre while that of diesel is at Rs 89.87. In Mumbai, petrol currently costs Rs 107.83, while diesel is retailing at Rs 97.45, data available on Indian Oil Corporation’s website showed. There has been no change in fuel prices so far in August. In July, petrol prices were hiked nine times while diesel rates were raised on five occasions and cut on one occasion. In June, both the auto fuel prices were hiked on 16 occasions, which followed the 16 hikes in the month of May after the oil marketing companies (OMCs) resumed their price revisions ending an 18-day hiatus that coincided with the assembly elections in key states. During this period, petrol price has increased by Rs 11.44 per litre and diesel has climbed by Rs 9.14 in New Delhi. Following the hikes since May 4, the price of petrol crossed the Rs 100-per-litre mark across many places in at least 19 states and union territories including Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Ladakh, Karnataka, Jammu and Kashmir (J&K), Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Bihar, Kerala, Punjab, Sikkim, Puducherry, Delhi and West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. In India, the fuel prices differ from state to state depending on the local taxation (VAT) and freight charges. Apart from this, the central government charges an excise duty on auto fuels. The OMCs revise rates of petrol and diesel daily based on the average price of benchmark fuel in the international market in the preceding 15-days, and foreign exchange rates. In the global market, oil prices dipped on Wednesday as analysts cut their forecasts for fuel demand in China following mobility curbs from the spread of the highly infectious Delta variant of the coronavirus, offsetting a bullish outlook for US fuel demand, news agency Reuters reported.  US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures fell 18 cents (0.3 per cent) to $68.11 a barrel at 0500 GMT, after a 2.7 per cent jump on Tuesday. Brent crude futures dropped 16 cents to $70.47 a barrel, following a 2.3 per cent gain on Tuesday, the report said.   📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

38,Daily briefing: India’s own Covid-19 drug; Supreme Court on Pegasus case; and more,"Good morning, Only in Express India could soon have an indigenously developed drug to cure Covid-19 in mild and moderately-infected patients. It is being tested by iSera Biological, a little known company in Maharashtra. Officials say the drug prevents the disease from further spreading in the body, and neutralises the existing virus. It promises to turn infected patients RT-PCR negative in 72-90 hours. To ensure sectoral viability, the government is likely to push for a floor price for services provided by telecom companies, which will essentially prevent companies from undercutting each other across services. The DoT and the Finance Ministry are said to be in agreement on the proposal, but they will need to bring the telecom regulator on board. The Indian cricket team’s backroom may soon undergo a total revamp. Head coach Ravi Shastri, bowling coach Bharat Arun, fielding coach R Sridhar and batting coach Vikram Rathour are all set to move on after the T20 World Cup in October-November in the UAE. Sources said the cricket board also wants a new group onboard. From the Front Page A Supreme Court bench headed by CJI N V Ramana told petitioners in the Pegasus case on Tuesday to “have some faith in the system” and resist from “having a parallel debate” on social media, while adjourning hearing on petitions until August 16. The counsel for the government had sought time to take instructions. With the Taliban advancing, India has evacuated its diplomats and personnel from its consulate in Mazar-e-Sharif. The country has issued a third advisory to its citizens to leave Afghanistan in view of the escalation in violence and the halt in air services to several provinces. Mazar-e-Sharif is a bustling city in the north, situated close to the border with Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. The BJP was in a spot on Tuesday when one of its MPs from election-bound UP batted for a caste-based census in Lok Sabha. Badaun MP Sanghmitra Maurya praised the Centre for “granting the power to the states for caste census”, and questioned Congress for not publishing it in 2011. However, the Centre has said it would not, as a matter of policy, enumerate the population caste-wise in the census — except for SCs and STs. Must Read In a move to check instances of state governments withdrawing cases against MPs and MLAs, the Supreme Court directed on Tuesday that such action cannot be taken without the consent of the state high court. It also ordered parties to publish details of criminal cases “within 48 hours of selection of candidate”. A week after a team was deputed to Kerala to investigate rising Covid-19 cases, a report has been submitted to the Centre listing nine unique challenges faced by the state in controlling the spread of the infection. The list includes a “faint” rural urban divide; a high number of cases of re-infection; high prevalence of NCDs; a 55% susceptible population; and high proportion of elderly population. A new study by the ICMR has found mixing Covishield and Covaxin is safe, and can also provide better immunity against Covid-19. Interestingly, the study was the result of a mistake. It included 18 participants from a village in Uttar Pradesh, who had been administered both vaccines in an error. So, should we be mixing vaccines? We explain. ICYMI Prime Minister Narendra Modi has taken strong exception to the absence of BJP MPs in Rajya Sabha, and sought a list of their names. Sources say he has told MPs to be regular in both Houses. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi was in Jammu and Kashmir on Tuesday — his first visit since Abrogation of Article 370 — where he demanded restoration of full statehood alongside “free and fair elections”. Wrestler Vinesh Phogat has been banned by the Wrestling Federation of India for staying and training away from Team India at the Tokyo Olympics. After Dil Chahta Hai and Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, Farhan Akhtar has surprised fans with the announcement of Jee Le Zaraa, starring a dreamy all-women cast of Priyanka Chopra, Katrina Kaif and Alia Bhatt. Following a slew of sexual harassment allegations against him, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has said he will resign. And Finally… No pain, no gain? The brief hockey player Amit Rohidas is given has been simple but fraught with danger. He is the first man in the four-man defence who runs straight at the drag-flicker. At Tokyo, Rohidas’ bravery stood out — he points to his chest, abdomen, knee and ankle to indicate where he was hit, but says he “remained mentally strong”. Delhi Confidential: CJI Ramana was thanked on Tuesday by a couple from Andhra Pradesh who he counselled in Telugu, and convinced to take back their complaints against each other and live happily.

39,57 J&K youths who went to Pak in 2017-18  became militants: DGP,"At least 57 youths from J&K who went to Pakistan in 2017 and 2018 either on tourist visa or study visa joined militancy, J&K Director General of Police Dilbagh Singh said on Tuesday. Speaking to reporters in Rajouri, Singh said a number of youth from J&K had gone to Pakistan in 2017 and 2018 on valid documents. “Fifty-seven cases have come to our notice that those who went across [the border] for studies or as tourists joined one or the other terror activity,” he said. The DGP said 30 of them returned to Kashmir as terrorists after illegally crossing the LoC with weapons. While 17 of the 30 have been killed, 13 are still active in Kashmir and security forces are keeping a watch on them, he said. Pointing out that 17 of them were still in Pakistan, Singh said this is the reason why authorities have been strict in the recent past in granting clearance to Kashmiri students for travel to Pakistan for studies. “This has been the reason for strictness as the youth goes from here for studies, but returns as terrorist,” he said. “I don’t know under what situation and circumstances students from J&K stay in Pakistan, but if they return as terrorists it is obvious that you have to become strict by strengthening the security system, which gives clearance.” In June this year, the J&K Students Association had written to Union Home Minister Amit Shah and J&K Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha, requesting their intervention in facilitating the travel of around 100 medical and engineering students from Kashmir to Pakistan. In its letter, it urged the authorities concerned to issue them the requisite no objection certificate for studying in Pakistan as sought from them by immigration officials in India. About the spurt in terror activities in J&K, DGP Singh said cross-border infiltration, which had come to a halt after the February 20 ceasefire agreement between India and Pakistan, has resumed from different terrorist launch pads in that country. Two terrorists killed recently in Rajouri’s Thanamandi area were also part of a fresh group that came from Pakistan. While a Shopian family has claimed the body of one of the slain terrorist, the other appears to be a Pakistani. Prior to this, two other groups infiltrating into Rajouri district from Pakistan were intercepted in Sunderbani and Nowshera areas recently.  “Of the 3-4 groups crossing into this area, while a number of terrorists in the first two groups have been killed, two of the four terrorists in the third group were killed in Thanamandi area,’’ Singh said. Pointing out that one group is suspected to have crossed over to Shopian in Kashmir, he said the police and security forces are continuing searches to track it. There has been fresh infiltration by a four-member group in Kashmir as well, he said. However, all four were killed in Bandipore on July 23-24 night, he added. 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

40,How the removal of Article 370 has set the stage for a long-standing transformation of Ladakh,"Over the past few days, there has been much discussion about Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decision to remove Articles 370 and 35 (A). For many Indians, this was a decision long overdue. The last two years have seen peace and progress in Jammu and Kashmir. However, as the Member of Parliament from Ladakh, I would like to throw light on how this period has been for the people of Ladakh, who are equally important stakeholders in the debates around 370 and 35 (A). Ladakh is a land of enchanting beauty and diversity. People of different faiths and communities co-exist here. Ladakh is also of great strategic importance to our nation. For decades, the people of Ladakh had aspirations which were not met in full. The most fundamental demand we had was to become a Union Territory — with the slogan “Free Ladakh from Kashmir” — so that our development needs are addressed faster. It was PM Modi who heeded this foundational demand of the people of Ladakh. Since Ladakh was made a UT, it feels like the government has moved closer to the people. Earlier, going to Srinagar or Jammu was tedious. Moreover, the complexities of the Valley and Jammu were such that Ladakh often featured as an afterthought. In the last two years we are already seeing glimpses of what is sure to be a glorious future for Ladakh. A budget allocation of almost Rs 6,000 crore, the highest ever, has been given to Ladakh during 2021-22. This will be used across different sectors to fulfil long-pending demands, particularly in healthcare, infrastructure connectivity and more. The allocation for the welfare of the ST community has also seen a sharp rise.  An integrated multi-purpose corporation is being proposed to take up various projects as per the specific needs of the Ladakh region. Such emphasis on localised governance to support the UT administration and the central government is laudable. It will give a shot in the arm to grassroots and participative governance. Whenever I have interacted with PM Modi, he has spoken about boosting the education levels in Ladakh. It is a matter of great happiness that the Sindhu Central University is being set up in Ladakh. This project is going to go a long way in augmenting educational infrastructure. The youngsters of Ladakh are talented, but are in need of the right nurturing, which this University will provide. Solar energy is a sector of the future. In that context, the MoU with the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) for setting up a 50 MW solar energy plant is a major positive development. Similarly, a tripartite MoU, between ONGC, the UT administration and Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council, Leh, for the first-ever Geothermal Field Development Project has been inked. I see these projects as beneficial for India’s energy requirements and our commitment to a sustainable future. Work has been progressing at a rapid pace in some areas in the last two years. Tunnel construction is happening faster and covering even the remotest areas like Drass and Lungnak. For a connectivity-deprived land, this is great news. Recently, Rs 1,300 crore was approved for laying an Inter-State Transmission line to connect Zanskar and the Nubra valley to the National Grid. Work is underway to ensure high speed internet access across Ladakh. Youngsters are particularly excited about this development as it brings the world to their phones. We are on track to realise the dream of a digital Ladakh through hundreds of 4G mobile towers under the Universal Service Obligation Fund. Ladakh is also home to the highest motorable roads in the world. The development of border infrastructure, such as the ongoing construction of the Zoji La Tunnel, the approval for the Shinkun La Tunnel, the Lachung La and Taglang La Tunnel, the road to Daulat Beg Oldi, Umling La road, Col. Rinchen Bridge at the river Shyok are strategically vital for us. Rs 250 crore has been allotted under the Changthang Development Package to build requirements for the people living in the eastern border villages of Ladakh. Such care towards remote areas is a welcome sign. The people of Ladakh can never forget February 3, 2019. That was the day PM Modi inaugurated many development works and laid the foundation stone for several more projects. He described Ladakh as a land of heroes and recalled Ladakh’s role in upholding the unity of India. Two projects that stand out are the Dah Hydroelectric project and the Srinagar-Alusteng-Drass- Kargil-Leh Transmission system which will cater to the power and water needs of Ladakh. The people of Ladakh often faced the brunt of delayed projects and rising project costs. In the last seven years, thanks to the vision of the Modi government, we are seeing a change in the old culture of keeping projects in suspended animation so that the pockets of a few could be lined. The PM also laid the foundation stone for a new terminal at the Kushok Bakula Rimpochee Airport. This will bring more tourists to Ladakh and take our people to different parts of our country and the world. For long, it was ingrained in us that Ladakh is an “also-ran” alongside more powerful participants. It was unthinkable that it would emerge from the shadow of others and that we would get the opportunity to shape our own destiny. What PM Modi did in 2019 has set the stage for a long-standing transformation of Ladakh, placing it in the fifth gear of development. He has successfully developed a sense of integration, security, and acceptance. He has respected and honoured us, moving us away from the erstwhile sense of isolation and insecurity.

41,"In Srinagar, Rahul Gandhi calls for full restoration of statehood to J&K","Senior Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday demanded restoration of full statehood to Jammu and Kashmir alongside “free and fair elections” to be held in J&K. Gandhi was speaking after inaugurating a Congress office in Srinagar — his first address to party workers after the abrogation of Article 370 and the bifurcation of J&K into two Union Territories. He had earlier in August 2019 attempted to visit Kashmir but was not allowed to leave Srinagar airport. In his address on Tuesday — the second day of his two-day visit to the UT —Gandhi said, “We are not allowed to speak in Parliament. Whether it is Pegasus, Rafale, J&K, corruption or unemployment, I cannot speak about it in Parliament.” The Congress leader added that all institutions in the country “are under attack”. “There is an attack on the whole country — J&K, Tamil Nadu or Bengal. The concept of India, the democratic structure and our Constitution are under attack.” Senior Congress leader and former chief minister Ghulam Nabi Azad, who also addressed the gathering, recalled the clampdown imposed throughout J&K after the abrogation of Article 370 and said that he and other party leaders tried to visit the Valley but were not permitted to do so. “I had to approach the Supreme Court which gave limited access. I could only visit Baramulla, Anantnag and Jammu,” he said. Gandhi stated that while the attack on the rest of the country is “indirect”, the attack is more direct in Jammu and Kashmir. “Our position is clear. Full statehood should be restored to J&K and the democratic process, in terms of free and fair elections should be held,” he said. “I fight against Narendra Modi. We will fight against him and his ideology — the ideology of dividing India and the ideology of violence — we will fight and defeat them.”  Azad, speaking of the June 24 meeting between the Prime Minister and the political leadership of J&K, said that the assurances given by the PM at the all-party meeting, including to the five-point programme proposed by Congress, will be considered. Gandhi said that the values on which India was founded also includes Kashmiriyat and “this feeling resides in me as well.” He added that while his family lives in New Delhi now, “before this, they lived at Allahabad and before that, they lived here. I may not have spent much time here but I can say that I understand you a little. When I come here, I feel like I am coming home.” 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

43,"Aamir Khan poses with Kiran Rao, son Azaad as he returns from Kashmir","Aamir Khan is back to Mumbai after spending some quality time in Jammu and Kashmir. The actor, along with his ex-wife Kiran Rao and son Azaad, was spotted at the Mumbai airport on Monday evening. Aamir was shooting for his upcoming film Laal Singh Chaddha in Srinagar and Kiran is a part of the production team. They were accompanied by son Azaad. While in Ladakh, the couple announced their separation while reiterating that they will continue to collaborate professionally together. “In these 15 beautiful years together we have shared a lifetime of experiences, joy and laughter, and our relationship has only grown in trust, respect and love. Now we would like to begin a new chapter in our lives — no longer as husband and wife, but as co-parents and family for each other,” they had said in a statement in July. Earlier this month, Aamir and Kiran discussed making the Union Territory a popular filming destination. The two had a conversation with Jammu and Kashmir Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha. At an event held on Friday in Srinagar, Aamir shared, “As beautiful as Kashmir, the people of Kashmir are just as beautiful. Ever since we have come here, our entire family is with us. My mother, sisters are here. Kiran’s parents are here. We are getting so much love and affection here.” Manoj Sinha expressed that the film policy “will transform Jammu Kashmir into the most preferred destination for the entertainment industry, reviving its halcyon days of being a cinematographer’s delight and bringing back the golden era of film shooting in the region.” “The government has set up single-window clearance mechanism; prepared equipment, location and talent directories besides offering fiscal incentives for filmmakers coming to the UT. The new policy aims at maximizing the potential of promising local talent and creating livelihood opportunities for many,” he added. Aamir Khan and Kiran Rao, who announced their separation earlier this year, were in Ladakh for the shooting of Laal Singh Chadha. Later, the two, along with son Azaad, shot for a schedule of the film in Srinagar. The film, directed by Advait Chauhan, is an official Hindi remake of Forrest Gump. It will release on December 2021. 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

44,Rahul Gandhi says visiting Kashmir feels like coming home,"Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday said it feels like “coming home” when he visits the Kashmir Valley as he pitched for restoration of Jammu and Kashmir’s statehood before the assembly elections. Addressing party workers after inaugurating a new party headquarters here, a visibly emotional Gandhi said, “My family lives in Delhi. Before that my family lived in Allahabad. And before Allahabad, my family lived here.” “I can tell you that I understand you, my family must have drank water from the river Jhelum. Kashmiriyat, the culture and thought process must be in me too. When I come here, I feel like I am coming home,” he said, while referring to his family ties to Kashmir and added that he had come with a message of love and respect. Gandhi, a former Congress president, said that there was an urgent need for restoration of statehood before holding the assembly elections. “Statehood should be restored and then the democratic process should be started, that is election (to state assembly),” he said. Before the event, Gandhi offered prayers at the Mata Kheer Bhawani shrine, the revered shrine of Kashmiri Pandits, in Ganderbal in central Kashmir. Reacting to the suggestion of senior party leader Ghulam Nabi Azad that a bill for the restoration of statehood to J-K be brought during the current session of Parliament, Gandhi said there were several issues that he wanted to raise in Parliament, but the opposition was not allowed to speak there. He said he was told by his colleagues that J-K was not a big state with many Lok Sabha seats, but stressed the importance of the place. “It is not a state with many Lok Sabha seats…It is not even a state now. But the strength of J-K is the way you live. India and its foundation has Kashmiriyat. This feeling is in me too. What you can get me to do with love and affection, you will never achieve it through force and hatred. That is Kashmiriyat. If you own J-K with love and respect, you will get done whatever you want to,” he said. The former Congress president said when his party was in power, it tried to unite and join the country, but the BJP believes in divisive ideology. “When we were in power, we started lots of programmes like Panchayat elections, Udaan, etc. We also brought in industrialists to invest in J-K. We were trying to unite and join. They (BJP) have attacked it,” he added. He said the new office building of the party’s J-K unit is a new beginning and added that the workers were the party’s army. “I tried to come here earlier also, before Covid outbreak, but I was not allowed beyond the airport,” he said, referring to his visit immediately after the Centre’s August 2019 decisions to abrogate Jammu and Kashmir’s special status and bifurcate it into union territories. “I will visit Jammu and Ladakh as well,” he added. Addressing the gathering earlier, Azad urged Gandhi to raise the issue of J-K in Parliament so that a bill that restores the statehood and protects land and job rights of locals is passed in Parliament within the remaining three days of the ongoing session. “I request Rahul ji to raise this issue, bring a bill in Parliament in the ongoing session that will restore the statehood and protect the land and job rights. There is not much to debate, it will take just five minutes,” Azad said. The former leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha said he and his colleagues tried to visit J-K in the aftermath of the Centre’s August 5, 2019 decisions, but were stopped. “I had to approach the Supreme Court which gave limited access. I could only visit Baramulla, Anantnag and Jammu,” he added. Azad expressed hope that the assurances given by the prime minister at an all-party meeting in June this year will be fulfilled. “At the all-party meeting, the PM gave assurances. We hope that he will fulfil those assurances including the five points raised by the Congress. They should restore statehood and then hold elections,” he said. Azad said that J-K cannot be a state like Delhi where every order has to be approved by the Lieutenant Governor. “J-K is a border state and the L-G cannot govern it. We don’t want a Delhi like state where L-G has to approve every order,” he said. On the protection of land rights, Azad said it was not Article 370 that gave this provision to J-K. “It was not a new law. It was passed by Maharaja Hari Singh in 1927. North East has special provisions on land rights while the Himachal Pradesh assembly has also passed a law. Why snatch it from JK?” he asked.  The former J-K chief minister said industrial activity in the Jammu region had suffered as 65 per cent of the 13,000 industrial units had shut down in the past two-and-a-half years. “Most of these units were manufacturing products which had a market in Kashmir,” he said, referring to the economic downturn in the UT. 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

45,"Would talk to Kashmir's youth for development, says Amit Shah after NC chief seeks Indo-Pak dialogue","SRINAGAR: Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Monday hit out at National Conference president Farooq Abdullah for seeking talks with Pakistan, saying the government would rather talk to the youth of Jammu and Kashmir for making it the most developed in the country. The home minister, who is on a visit to Jammu and Kashmir -- his first since the abrogation of Article 370 in August 2019 -- remotely inaugurated several development projects and laid the foundation stone of some.  ""I read in newspapers that Farooq Abdullah has suggested that the government should talk to Pakistan. He has a right to his opinion but we would rather talk to the Kashmiri youth,"" Shah said while addressing a function at the SKICC here. ""The repealing of Article 370 had only one intention -- to put Kashmir, Jammu and newly created Ladakh (Union Territory) on the path of development. You will see the fruits of our efforts by 2024,"" he said. The article, which granted special status to the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir, was abrogated in August 2019 and the state was bifurcated into union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh. Shah inaugurated a 500-bed hospital at Bemina, completed at a cost of Rs 115 crore, laid the foundation stone for the Handwara Medical College, a Rs 46-crore steel girder bridge over the Ferozepur Nallah in Baramulla district and road projects worth Rs 4,000 crore, among others. The home minister, who is on his Jammu and Kashmir visit's third day, said that those who advocate talks with Islamabad and separatists should be asked what has Pakistan done in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). ""Compare the development between this side and PoK. Do they have electricity, roads, healthcare and toilets. There is nothing (on the other side). You (Kashmiris) have the same rights as any other Indian,"" he said. Without naming the Congress, the National Conference and the Peoples' Democratic Party, he said while only three medical colleges were set up by the ""three families which have ruled Jammu and Kashmir"", Prime Minister Narendra Modi has ensured seven new medical colleges and these are coming up. ""Earlier, 500 youths could become doctors. Now 2,000 youths can become doctors from these new medical colleges. Nobody will need to go to Pakistan to study medicine,"" he said. Shah said the schemes and the plans of the Modi government will ensure that Jammu and Kashmir will be the most developed province of the country. He sought the cooperation of the people to realise this dream. ""It is only the youth of Jammu and Kashmir who can work towards achieving this goal,"" he said. Asserting that the government is aiming to wipe out terrorism from Jammu and Kashmir and put an end to civilian killings, Shah said nobody would be allowed to disrupt peace and development in the Union Territory, which has a special place in Prime Minister Modi's heart. Defending the curbs on internet services and imposition of curfew in the aftermath of abrogation of Article 370, he said that ""some people would have misled the masses. Who would have been killed? The Kashmiri youth. We know how heavy the coffin of a young son is for an old man"". He said that 40,000 people have been killed in Kashmir in violence and it should stop now. ""This many people do not die even in wars. We have to come back and take Kashmir to new heights of development,"" he said. The minister said Rs 12,000 crore worth of investment has already come to the Union Territory and the government aims at a total of Rs 51,000 crore by the end of 2022 to provide five lakh jobs to the local youth. Shah said ""three families"" are answerable to the people for their failure to develop Jammu and Kashmir over the past seven decades. ""The new phase of development under the leadership of Modi has started in J&K but attempts are being made by inimical elements to create hurdles. I have come here to assure you that nobody will be able to create a hurdle and disrupt peace and development,"" Shah said. He said a new phase of development has started and this cannot be stopped by anyone. Listing various steps taken by the government since the formation of the BJP government at the Centre, Shah said five lakh jobs are being created in Jammu and Kashmir, while 20,000 people have been provided government jobs in the past two years. ""The three families used to say who will come and invest in J&K. In just six months after announcing a new industrial policy, we have got an investment of Rs 7,000 crore in Jammu and Rs 6,000 crore in Kashmir and are looking forward to an investment of Rs 50,000 crore by the end of 2022, the minister said. Targeting the ""three families"", he said they were asking what the government is going to give to Jammu and Kashmir. ""We have a long list of what we have given to J&K and the people know it very well but the people are demanding an answer from them as to what they have given to J&K despite ruling the erstwhile state for the past seven decades. Have you thought of anyone else other than your own family members?""

46,Kashmiri students allegedly beaten up at Punjab college after 'cheering' Pakistan in T20 World Cup match,"CHANDIGARH: After India lost the T20 World Cup match against Pakistan on Sunday, Kashmiri students allegedly cheering the neighbouring country were reportedly beaten up at an engineering college in Sangrur and at another educational institution in Kharar in Punjab by other students, most of whom were from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Haryana. A video on social media purportedly showed a Kashmiri student alleging that some students from Uttar Pradesh barged into their room. ""We were watching the match here and some students from Uttar Pradesh forcibly came inside and hit us,"" a student claimed.  Sources said students hailing from Kashmir and others belonging to UP, Bihar and Haryana were watching the match in their respective rooms at Bhai Gurdas Institute of Engineering and Technology in Sangrur.  Kashmiri students are housed in two wings of the hostel of the engineering college and were allegedly cheering Pakistan and raising 'azadi' slogans. After the match finished, they allegedly burst firecrackers and celebrated the win of the neighbouring country. This did not go well with other students from UP and Bihar who went inside the rooms of the Kashmiri students and had a heated argument which led to a scuffle. In another incident, about half a dozen students from Kashmir were allegedly beaten up at Rayat Bahrat University near Kharar by students from Haryana after the match ended. Speaking to The New Indian Express, J&K Students Association founder and national spokesperson Nasir Khuehami claimed that Kashmiri students were thrashed in Sangrur and Kharar by students from Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana and they were rescued by other students. The students who barged into their rooms vandalised them, he alleged. ""Some twelve students were beaten up by a group of students in Bhai Gurdas Institute of Engineering and Technology at Sangrur and another about half a dozen were thrashed at Rayat Bahrat University in Kharar,"" he said. ""We spoke to students who were assaulted in Sangrur last night. They informed me there is no apology from any side till now,"" he said. Confirming that such an incident took place, Inspector General of Police Patiala (Range) MS Chinna said, ""There was a scuffle between students from Kashmir and UP and Bihar.

The community organised a two-day event at the popular National Mall where participants said that targeted killings have been especially gruesome, and the home-grown terrorist insurgency remains dependent on resources and inspiration from Pakistan.  ""The killings of the minorities by the Pakistan-based terrorist in the Kashmir Valley needs to be stopped,” said Dr. Shakun Malik, a Kashmiri Pandit activist from Washington DC area. Indian Govt must take steps to ensure the safety of local minorities of Kashmir valley who remain targets for the future,"" she said. Eleven civilians, including two teachers, a pharmacy owner and five non-local labourers, have been killed by militants in separate attacks in the valley this month. In a press release, the community said that the murder of Makhan Lal Bindroo has ""brought back the tragic memories of the 1990s, when more than half a million indigenous Kashmiris were forced leave their lives in the Kashmir valley. Bindroo, a prominent Kashmiri Pandit and owner of Srinagar's most famous pharmacy, was shot dead at his shop earlier this month. Organised on the grounds of the National Mall here, the event coincided with October 22 as on this day in 1947, Pakistan invaded the Jammu and Kashmir as part of 'Operation Gulmarg', aimed at conquering Jammu and Kashmir on the basis that the region has a Muslim majority.

50,Amit Shah's Jammu and Kashmir visit was necessary in aftermath of recent killings: Farooq Abdullah,"JAMMU: National Conference (NC) president Farooq Abdullah on Saturday said Union Home Minister Amit Shah's visit to Jammu and Kashmir was imperative in the backdrop of the recent targeted killings of civilians that have triggered panic among the minorities and non-local labourers who have started fleeing the valley. The former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister, however, questioned the claim of the BJP that militancy has been wiped out from the Union Territory.  ""Jammu and Kashmir is under the direct rule of the Centre and the emerging situation demanded his (Shah's) visit, which was imperative. He has come and people have high hopes that this (targeted attacks) will end and he will be able to provide security to them,"" he said. Eleven civilians, including two teachers, a pharmacy owner and five non-local labourers, have been killed by militants in separate attacks in the valley this month. Speaking in Rajouri district on the first day of his three-day tour of the Pir Panchal region, Abdullah said many in the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) are claiming that militancy has been finished and the borders have been sealed in Jammu and Kashmir. ""If the claim is true, one wonders how they (militants) come and carry out the attacks,"" he added. The NC leader said 900 youngsters, who were accused of stone-pelting in the past, have been arrested ahead of the home minister's visit to the Union Territory. ""Will you get peace by arresting the youngsters? Your policies are not favourable to Jammu and Kashmir and the fact of the matter is that you are polarising people and creating a big danger for the country with an eye on the upcoming election in Uttar Pradesh,"" he said. Abdullah said it is better for the BJP to lose the Uttar Pradesh polls rather than winning the election by ""spreading hatred and dividing communities"". He said nobody is willing to come to Kashmir in view of the emerging situation that has led to the migration of labourers and Kashmiri Pandits who had got jobs under the prime minister's package here. ""They are seeking investors but who will come to invest under the present situation? I do not see any development happening in Jammu and Kashmir (post the abrogation of Article 370 of the Constitution in 2019). They (Centre) promised 50,000 jobs but where did these jobs go? Inflation has broken the backbone of the poor,"" the former chief minister said. He urged the government to give salaries to the Kashmiri Pandits who have returned to Jammu out of fear. Referring to the all-party meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi, Abdullah said no concrete step was taken to remove ""Dilli ki Doori and Dil Ki Doori"" as promised by him. ""Political prisoners are still in jails, which is very unfortunate.

He said Pakistan’s proxy war was aimed at creating a fear-psychosis as “a semblance of peace and tranquility was happening” in Jammu & Kashmir.  Speaking at the 1st Ravi Kant Singh Memorial lecture series in Guwahati, he said whenever Jammu & Kashmir was relatively peaceful, Pakistan would create a situation where innocent people would be killed to generate fear. “We should not allow the exodus to happen at all.

57,Security beefed up across Kashmir ahead of Home Minister Amit Shah's visit,"SRINAGAR: Security has been beefed up across Kashmir ahead of Union Home Minister Amit Shah's maiden visit to the Valley after the abrogation of Article 370 on Saturday, officials said. They said a thick security cover has been thrown around the BJP office at Jawahar Nagar in the city where Shah is likely to pay a visit.  Similarly, roads leading to Sher-i-Kashmir International Convention Centre (SKICC) have been made off-limits for three days from Saturday as the Union home minister is expected to attend an event there, they added. It will be Shah's first visit to Kashmir after the Centre revoked J-K's special status and bifurcated the erstwhile state into union territories in August 2019. The officials said additional deployment of security forces has been made across the valley, especially in Srinagar. Official sources said 50 companies of additional paramilitary forces are being inducted into the valley in the wake of the recent spate of civilian killings.

58,Kashmir: A Forgotten History – V,"In this series, we have attempted to redress the glaring academic and political neglect of the longue durée historical identity of Kashmir. We have delved into essential aspects of 2,000 years of her formative history, which show that Kashmir was historically never isolated or insular, as she is made out to be, but incredibly open and cosmopolitan; and she was overwhelmingly Indic in her genesis and composition rather than ‘unique’. In the previous four parts, we saw how early Kashmir’s archaeology, historical geography, linguistics, writing systems, political formations and even demography were dynamically shaped in sync with other regions of India—a connected history long silenced and conveniently forgotten by the rush to separatist politics. It is no wonder then that for the first two millennia, Kashmiri culture—art, religion, philosophy and literature—also resonated with the Indic and vice versa.  Thus, as John Siudmak has shown, Kashmiri stone art or sculpture, in every one of its stages from the 4th century onwards at Bijbehara, Baramulla and Pandrethan, displayed a constant and concrete synchronicity with Gupta, post-Gupta and Pala art styles of three centres thousands of miles away, namely, Sarnath (UP), Udayagiri (MP) and Nalanda (Bihar)! The shared idiom was possibly because of itinerant artists from these places coming to work in ateliers in Kashmir. This repertoire included all-India icons such as the Buddha, Bodhisattvas, Trimurti, Vaikuntha Vishnu, Ekamukha Linga, Maheshvara as Bhuteshvara, many-armed Durga Mahishasuramardini, Ganesha, Kartikeya, and Matrikas like Indrani and Chamunda, complete with ensigns like yagnopavit (sacred thread), vanamala (garland) and vahana (vehicles). In fact, did you know, even the beautiful iconography on standard Kashmiri gold coins, right from the Kushanas (2nd century) and Kidaras (5th century) for the next 1,200 years (!) depicts Shiva with his trishula (trident) on the obverse and a seated Sri Lakshmi, lotus in hand, on the reverse, a formula familiar from other North Indian dynastic issues as well. Famed Kashmiri bronzes, preserved in the monasteries of Ladakh and Tibet, also show the influence of the late Buddhist Pala school of Bihar and Bengal. Fascinatingly, the Rajatarangini narrates how King Lalitaditya (8th century) brought back with him to Kashmir from Magadha (Bihar) colossal Buddha statues gleaming in bronze, strapped on the backs of elephants—a local memory of a momentous transfer of artwork that evokes the artistic and religious interconnectedness of the two regions. Indeed from the very beginning, Kashmiris worshipped the same deities as the rest of India, be it Shiva, Shakti, Vishnu or the Buddha. It is Kashmiris who took Buddhism to China and Central Asia on the one hand, and esoteric Shiva Advaita (Kashmir Shaivism) to the Deccan on the other. While preserving their own special rituals, Kashmiris observed all the same festivals as the rest of India, be it Ganesh Chaturthi (Pann), Shivaratri (Herath) or Janmashtami (Zaramsatam), even as the Devi remained central to Kashmiri selfhood. It is no wonder then that, dedicated to Shakti-Saraswati, the Sharada temple, at present lying derelict in PoK, was once thronged by devotees from as far as Bengal in the 8th century and was listed by Al Biruni in the 11th century as among the top three shrines of all of Al Hind (India). And till today, some Hindu prayers in the South include the invocation sharadadevi kashmir-pura-vasini namostute (salutations to the goddess Sharada of Kashmir). Premodern Indic connectivity, and Kashmir’s role in it, are truly mind-boggling! This is perhaps best captured by the tradition of the great 8th century seer-intellectual Shankaracharya’s three tours of philosophical conquest across the length and breadth of this country. Each time, setting out from his home in Kaladi, Kerala, he consciously chose none other than Kashmir—again the Sharadapeeth, the seat of all learning (sarvagyapeeth)—as the fitting culmination of his scholarly travels. The ancient Shankaracharya temple at Srinagar still stands witness to this epic visit as also to the astonishing centrality of Kashmir to the imagination of South India and vice versa. And finally, not to forget the long line of virtuoso Kashmiri grammarians like Patanjali; poets like Kalhana, Bilhana, Somadeva and Kshemendra; linguists and rhetoricians like Vamana, Udbhata, Mammata and Anandavardhana; musicologists like Sharangadeva; and philosophers and yogis like Utpaladeva and the doyen Abhinavagupta: These scholars from the Valley revolutionised Sanskrit literature, ethics, aesthetics and metaphysics, virtually monopolising the intellectual scene across the subcontinent from the first into the second millennium CE. Their works circulated widely and were studied as learned models as far as, again, the deep South, something that a scholar has colourfully described as saffron in the rasam! So thoroughly Indic was Kashmir's foundational history and so crucial was Kashmiri participation in the subcontinent's affairs in the longue durée. How did this happen if Kashmir was never a part of India? And yet thousands of lives have been lost over this question! I believe the erasure of this history from living memory is the root of disinformation and conflict in the Valley. The Kashmiri today may not know from where they come and what their rich Indic legacy is, thanks to the fallacious identity discourse of the separateness of their land—a discourse that has done great epistemic violence most of all to the Kashmiri community, severing them from their own, very proud past. However, history cannot be wished away simply because it does not suit politics. Instead, it is perhaps precisely in the reclamation and acceptance of her plural, open and cosmopolitan histories that the path to peace and reconciliation in Kashmir may yet lie.

Shah is likely to visit Kashmir on Saturday when the first international flight from Srinagar to Sharjah will take off.  However, police officials said the shutting down of the internet and seizing of two-wheelers has nothing to do with Shah's visit but was part of routine anti-terror measures.

He also said that the National Conference was never a pro-Pakistan party and always worked for the betterment of all, irrespective of their caste, creed and religion.  ""They (BJP) used to say after abrogation of Article 370 (in August 2019) that they have restored peace in J&K Where is the promised peace and development? Give answers to the people,"" Abdullah said addressing party workers in Ramban district. Eleven civilians, including two teachers, a pharmacy owner and five non-local labourers, were killed in targeted attacks by terrorists in different parts of the Kashmir valley this month. Without naming the BJP or the central government, the former chief minister said the recent killings have shattered all the claims made in the aftermath of the August 5, 2019 development. ""They are talking about 'Ram Rajya' but the fact is that they do not know anything about it. In 'Ram Rajya', there is no discrimination and all the people whether Muslims, Hindus, Sikh or Christians are treated equally,"" he said. Referring to the statement of former prime minister A B Vajpayee ""you can change friends but not neighbours"", Abdullah said friendship between India and Pakistan holds the key to peace in the region. However, he said the National Conference has never been a pro-Pakistan party. ""The aim of National Conference is to serve the people of all faiths without any discrimination, provide better living to them, ensure they educate their children and bring laurels to J&K and the country,"" he said. ""Our enemies have always conspired against us but they never succeeded in the past nor will they succeed in future. We will live and die here,"" the NC president said.

I will not go there again to earn my livelihood,"" said a distraught Mintu Singh, a labourer from Chattisgargh, holding a cricket bat. Like him, scores of migrant labourers and their families have fled the Valley, saying they have experienced ""hell'' in the last couple of weeks after terrorists carried out targeted killings of 11 non-locals.  Many said they may not ever come back to Kashmir again. Ajay Kumar of Besangoan, Bihar, who fled along with his wife Sarita and two kids from a brick kiln at Pulwama in South Kashmir and reached Jammu railway station, wept bitterly saying his employer refused to pay Rs 27,000 in pending wages. Several others had the same complaint and appealed to authorities to intervene. ""I am very unhappy leaving the valley. This has become hell. We come here to earn for our families not to get killed on streets,"" said Chintu Singh, who had been working for four-five months every year in the Valley for over a decade now. ""I brought this gift (cricket bat) from Kashmir for a friend's children. It is the last gift from Kashmir. I will not come to Kashmir again to earn livelihood. The situation is very bad due to fear and terror there (as result of killings)"", said Singh, who fled along with a group of 20 Hindu labourers working in a brick kiln in Pulwama district. Thousands of labourers, mostly Hindus and some Muslims, from different states arrived at railway stations and bus stands in Jammu and Udhampur after leaving the Valley. While some labourers said that their wages were paid, there were others who complained that they were driven out by employers in the valley forcibly without their wages. ""We had no money. I along with my wife and two children got some money from others and left the valley. The owner forced us out without paying us the remaining wages"", said Ajay Kumar and showed a diary with his wage bill. Like him, Ram Sharan and Santosh Kumar of Bihar, and Rakesh Dass and Alok Chand Darma (Chattisgarh) also complained about non-payment of wages and urged authorities to facilitate the transfer of their wages from their employers in Kashmir valley. Chunni Devi from Jharkhand, who reached Jammu railway station in a Tata Sumo vehicle from Kashmir along with her husband and children, said, ""We came to Kashmir after getting to know it is paradise of earth. But it is not paradise. It is hell."" ""They have shown us pictures of hell. They killed innocent Hindu labourers. We will never come to Kashmir to work again"". She said that they were living in constant fear after the killings. ""Our parents and family in Jharkhand were also anxious for our safety. Now we are in Jammu. There is no fear. We will go to Punjab, Haryana or Delhi to earn our livelihood, but not Kashmir,"" she said. The labourers complained they received little help from the administration and the police.

Addressing a press conference, AAP MLA Atishi said the match should not be held until Pakistan stops sponsoring terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir.  She also sought to know Prime Minister Narendra Modi's opinion on this issue. ""We are seeing repeated attacks on Indians in Kashmir. There should not be a cricket match with Pakistan under these circumstances. Our prime minister will agree to this,"" Atishi said. The MLA was asked if her party supports demands for cancellation of the India-Pakistan match at the T-20 World Cup in view of the recent killing of civilians by terrorist in Kashmir. ""I am sure that not only the AAP but even the BJP and its leadership as well as the prime minister will agree that until Pakistan stops sponsoring terror attacks in India territory, there should not be any cricket match between India and Pakistan,"" she said.

66,NIA likely to take over Kashmir civilian killings probe,"NEW DELHI: The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) is likely to hand over the probe of recent civilian killings in Kashmir to the National Investigation Agency (NIA), sources in the security set up said here on Tuesday. According to sources, the investigation in these killings indicate a definite pattern leading to the terror angle, therefore, the investigation may be assigned to the national anti-terror probe agency.  They also said that this issue was discussed threadbare in the National Security Strategy Conference held on Monday wherein Union Home Minister Amit Shah discussed it with all stakeholders in detail. Another source in the government set up said that civilian killings in Kashmir have given a wrong signal and most of the migrant labourers and non-Kashmiris are leaving Kashmir leading to a sense of fear among the local residents too. These gruesome incidents have also spread fear among the Kashmiris Pandits who were willing to go back to the valley on behest of the government initiatives. The local NIA team has already been assisting the J&K Police in the killings probe and trying to identify the masterminds behind these killings. The sources also said that the central agencies have been scanning the old cases of stone pelters as targeted killings revealed that these killers are not from the regular terrorists' cadre. ""The probe agency will take over the cases of Kashmiri Pandit Pharmaceutical dealer Makhan Lal Bindroo; Virendra Paswan, a non-Kashmiri street vendor from Bihar and the other labourers,"" the senior officials added. The NIA Director General Kuldeep Singh visited Srinagar on Monday and reportedly discussed the situation with other security stakeholders.

67,"Amid civilian killings, migrant workers say 'too much fear', as they board trains out of Kashmir","SRINAGAR: It was cold under the open skies but the group of migrant workers at the station here bore the chill autumn winds with stoicism through the night, the presence of security forces dispelling somewhat the fear that was propelling them to leave Kashmir ahead of schedule. Anxious to return home after the spate of killings targeting minorities, non-locals and other civilians in the Valley, about 50 migrant labourers, many of them from Bihar, arrived at the Nowgam railway station late on Monday night from nearby Budgam district where they worked in brick kilns.  ""We spent the night in the open but we felt more secure due to the presence of security forces guarding the railway station,"" Mithilesh Kumar told PTI at the station on Tuesday. ""We are leaving Kashmir earlier than usual. There is too much fear, "" he added. Trains are the preferred route out of the Valley with many saying they will ensure their safety for the rest of the journey. Kumar said the group will take a train to Banihal on the other side of the Pir Panjal range and then catch a taxi or bus to Jammu for the onward journey to Bihar. ""Nobody told us to leave but who will be responsible if someone among us gets killed. One moment we are told security will be provided and the next we are on our own,"" said Deepak Kumar, a resident of Bihar's Madhubani district. On Sunday, two labourers from Bihar were gunned down when terrorists barged into their accommodation in Kulgam district, taking the number of civilians killed in targeted attacks in Jammu and Kashmir this month to 11. Another labourer sustained bullet injuries. The killings of civilians have led to many migrant workers making their way back home though many in the city have decided to stay on in the search for work. The money, they said, is better and the local residents are kind. The workers at Nowgam station, waiting to board a train out, agreed. Many praised the locals and said they ensured the group reached the station safely. ""People of Kashmir are kind but few people do politics and the masses have to suffer,"" Deepak Kumar said. There were also reports of migrant labourers from other parts of the Valley leaving in taxis and buses early in the morning. However, hundreds could also be seen at major intersections in the city, hoping to be hired for work. Hawal Chowk, rechristened Bihari Chowk by city dwellers, has not witnessed any significant decrease in the number of migrant workers there. The first migrant worker -- Virender Paswan -- was shot dead by militants in Hawal area. The scenes were no different at Rambagh, less than two kilometres from where prominent Kashmiri Pandit businessman Makhan Lal Bindroo was shot dead at point blank range in his shop earlier this month. Lakhs of labourers from different parts of the country come to the Valley every year in early March for skilled and unskilled jobs such as masonry, carpentry, welding and farming, and go back home before the onset of winter in November. This year, however, several are choosing to go back before they had planned to. On Monday, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar condemned the targeted killing of Bihari migrant workers in Jammu and Kashmir and said the incidents had created an ""environment of fear"".

69,'Better to go home than to risk our lives': Fear-stricken migrants exit Kashmir amid killings,"SRINAGAR: After the spate in targeted killings of non-resident labourers by militants in Kashmir, non-locals are leaving the Valley in fear. “We are scared. I am a gol gappe seller. Two gol gappe sellers have been killed here. One of them, Arbind Kumar, who was killed in Iddgah area of Srinagar a few days back was a neighbour in my native village. Now, I am fearing for life and leaving for home,” said Vikas Chaudhary, a Bihar resident. Many non-local skilled and unskilled labourers have left Srinagar in J&K Road Transport Corporation (JKRTC) buses, cabs and trains for Jammu. Another Bihar resident Ashish Kumar, who is a labourer and staying in Srinagar, said after the targeted killings, his relatives back home were worried about his safety. “On the insistence of my family and on account of the situation, my family and I are leaving for our hometown. It is better to go home than to risk our lives.”  As many as 12 civilians, including five non-locals, three minority community members and three local Muslims, have been killed by militants in the Valley this month. “It is for the first time that non-local labourers are being targeted by militants in Kashmir. It has spread fear,” said Mukesh Kumar of Bihar. He said his family back home were insisting on his return. “I am leaving Kashmir with a heavy heart,” Mukesh said. Dananjay, another non-local labourer from Bihar, said he was also leaving because of  security worries. An ice cream seller, Dananjay said he had been living in the Valley for six years but never faced such a situation before. Another non-local labourer Manilal Paswan said none forced them to leave the Valley. “We are leaving on our own because of the security situation.

70,CRPF DG in Kashmir Valley to expedite work on safe camps for labourers,"NEW DELHI:  Aiming to accelerate construction of special security camps for migrant workers in Kashmir, the DG of CRPF, who also happens to be the DG of NIA, flew to the Valley on Monday to review the arrangements.  Sources said the main purpose of his visit, which comes in the wake of a spate in targeted killings of non-locals, is to review the final arrangements made for the proposed security camps, the construction work on which is likely to begin soon.    Highly placed sources said that the DG, Kuldeep Singh, asked agencies to compile data on the number of non-locals in the Valley and the present security arrangements available for them. Singh, who would be camping in the Valley for next few days, would apprise the home ministry about the number of camps that would be required, the timeline in which these camps could be readied and the necessary resources that would be required to build these camps, a top government functionary told this newspaper. “The Union Ministry of Home Affairs is likely to deploy more CRPF companies in the Valley for the protection of these camps. Orders to this effect may be issued soon,” the official said. Sources said that for the time being, senior security officials were toying with the idea of converting schools that were not in use into temporary shelters for the non-locals. “Details such as the number of non-locals are being compiled along with the security arrangements that have been made for Pandits, Sikhs and non-locals  living in Kashmir,” said a senior security official. A similar plan to secure non-locals in Kashmir had been put in place right after the abrogation of Article 370.",2,2,new delhi aiming accelerate construction special security camp migrant worker kashmir dg crpf happens dg nia flew valley monday review arrangement source said main purpose visit come wake spate targeted killing non local review final arrangement proposed security camp construction work likely begin soon highly placed source said dg kuldeep singh asked agency compile data number non local valley present security arrangement available singh camping valley day apprise home ministry number camp required timeline camp readied necessary resource required build camp government functionary told newspaper union ministry home affair likely deploy crpf company valley protection camp order effect issued soon official said source said time senior security official toying idea converting school use temporary shelter non local detail number non local compiled security arrangement pandits sikh non local living kashmir said senior security official similar plan secure non local kashmir place right abrogation article,0.9186,0.146,0.826,0.028,0.00550015082266786,1
71,Targeted killing of Bihari migrants in Jammu and Kashmir matter of serious concern: Nitish Kumar,"NEW DELHI:  Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar said on Monday that this time, “terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir have zeroed in on Biharis.” “The killing of Bihari workers by the terrorists who barged into their room in J&K was not of normal nature. Something dangerously peculiar is happening in J&K,” Kumar said.   Stating that J&K was an integral part of India and everyone had the right to go there, Kumar said, “Outsiders including Biharis must not be targeted.”   “Kuch to garbari hai aur action hona chahiye” (Something is amiss and action must be taken),” he said on Monday. Meanwhile, a pall of gloom has descended over the houses of Yogendra Rishidev (35) and Raja Rishidev (32), who were gunned down by the militants in J&K on Sunday. Both Yogendra and Raja were working as labourers in J&K.  “Where is my son Yogendra? He said he would send me money?” Karni Devi (50) would say whenever she regained her consciousness. Devi had fainted on hearing the news about her son getting killed. Yogendra had gone to J&K promising his mother to build a new house from his earnings. He is survived by three minor children. Tej Rishidev — the father in-law of Yogendra — told media that his minor grandchildren were shocked to such an extent that none of them had eaten anything since Sunday night. “How we will be able to keep all these children after the death of their father who was the lone breadwinner of the family? Rinku, the wife of Yogendra, has got bed-ridden after hearing about Yogendra.”",2,2,new delhi bihar chief minister nitish kumar said monday time terrorist jammu kashmir zeroed bihari killing bihari worker terrorist barged room normal nature dangerously peculiar happening kumar said stating integral india right kumar said outsider including bihari targeted kuch garbari hai aur action hona chahiye amiss action taken said monday pall gloom descended house yogendra rishidev raja rishidev gunned militant sunday yogendra raja working labourer son yogendra said send money karni devi say regained consciousness devi fainted hearing news son getting killed yogendra gone promising mother build new house earnings survived minor child tej rishidev father law yogendra told medium minor grandchild shocked extent eaten sunday night able child death father lone breadwinner family rinku wife yogendra got bed ridden hearing yogendra,-0.981,0.05,0.729,0.22,0.00550015082266786,1
72,"Two more non-locals killed in Jammu and Kashmir, L-G Manoj Sinha vows harsh response","SRINAGAR: Two more non-Kashmiri workers were shot dead in J&K on Sunday in the latest attack targeting civilians. Terrorists entered the rented residence of the Bihari labourers — Raja Reshi Dev and Joginder Reshi Dev — in Wanpoh, Ganjipora in Kulgam on Sunday and fired indiscriminately, killing them on the spot. This raises the number of civilian fatalities to at least 12 since the month began.  J&K Lt Governor Manoj Sinha condemned the killings and promised a strong response, saying “We’ll hunt down terrorists, their sympathisers and avenge every drop of innocent civilians blood.” After Sunday’s shootings, which also left another non-local labourer injured but in stable condition, Inspector General of Police (Kashmir) Vijay Kumar purportedly issued an advisory calling on police officials to bring all non-local labourers in their respective jurisdictions to nearest police, CRPF and army establishments.  However, the IGP later denied issuing the order, which went viral on social media, calling it fake. A police official said security in and around the areas where the non-locals are staying has been increased and patrolling intensified. Many non-locals left the Valley since October 5, when the targeted killings by militants started. As per estimates, about 50,000 migrant labourers are living in Kashmir. Meanwhile, the Army is continuing its search for a group of militants hiding in the forests of Poonch district.

73,Wanton civilian killings to scare people in Kashmir,"Managing Kashmir at the best of times is difficult, with or without Article 370 and 35A. Looks like the worst of times is knocking on the Valley’s door as seismic changes around the region have altered the geostrategic balance. The targeted killing of civilians since a couple of weeks has added a new layer to the reign of terror in Kashmir where encounter deaths have already escalated. While the intention to scare is visible, security forces are struggling to deal with The Resistance Force, the new entity apparently floated by Pakistan to take responsibility for the wanton bloodshed. Pakistan can be expected to further push terrorists in before winter sets in and Nature makes the border impregnable for a few months. The messy US drawdown from Afghanistan and Taliban capturing power has anyway made Af-Pak the most unpredictable and dangerous region in the world. For whatever reason, the pressure of further refugee influx on Pakistan’s western border has reduced, leaving Islamabad ample time and resources to mess around in Kashmir earlier than expected. Add to that its all-weather friend China’s rigidity during the latest border talks on the Ladakh face-off and the diplomatic frost in India’s north and west has only become deeper. That the US no longer has the ability to be a counterweight to deter Pakistan from turning on the terror tap is a given. And the ability of multilateral agencies like the IMF and the FATF to squeeze out Islamabad’s terror financing is questionable.  Early this year, both India and Pakistan exchanged vows to restore peace along the LoC by agreeing on a ceasefire after years of border shelling. It carried the promise of improving bilateral ties as there were some attempts at legacy-making. Simultaneously, the Modi government pushed the development envelope in J&K, setting the tone for Assembly polls after delimitation to expand the space for democracy. But back-channel talks failed, giving the Imran government the excuse to go back on the beaten path. Imran’s recent run-in with the military over the procedure to appoint a new ISI chief notwithstanding, he continues to be the army’s political arm.

74,"Non-locals jittery, keep watch on Jammu and Kashmir situation as civilian killings continue","SRINAGAR:  The targeted killing of non-locals by militants in Kashmir has caused fear among the skilled and unskilled labourers from other states working in the Valley. They are keeping a close watch and say if more killings take place, they may be forced to leave.  Meanwhile, several non-local workers have been leaving Kashmir since last week. Mohammad Shaheen, a native of West Bengal but now living in Delhi, said that for the last three decades, he had been working in Kashmir. “It is the first time that non-local street vendors and labourers are being targeted in J&K,” he said. In the last fortnight, 10 civilians, including three minority community members, three non-locals and four local Muslims have been shot dead by militants.  “There used to be movement of people on roads till  9 pm but now people prefer to return home by 6 pm,” said Shaheen, adding that if more killings took place, non-locals might  be forced to return to native places. “People won’t risk their lives to earn money,” Shaheen added. Meanwhile, an official of the J&K Road Transport Corporation said a 48-seater bus daily plies from Srinagar to Jammu at 7.30 am and since last week around 40 passengers in the bus each day are non-locals. A cab operator in Srinagar said that in the last two weeks, around 30 cabs have been leaving for Jammu daily as the number of passengers leaving the city increased after the civilian killings. “A fortnight back, only 10-15 cabs used to ply from Srinagar to Jammu daily,” he said, adding that many non-locals have left the Valley in the last fortnight. After the targetted killings by militants, IGP Kashmir Vijay Kumar purportedly issued an advisory calling on district police chiefs to bring all non-locals in their jurisdictions to nearest police, CRPF and army units. However, the IGP later denied issuing such an order and termed it fake. J&K L-G Manoj Sinha, while condemning the killings has said, “We’ll hunt down terrorists, their sympathisers and avenge innocent civilian’s blood”. Poonch operation continues
For the seventh consecutive day, army troops on Sunday continued their operation against militants hiding in the dense forests of Poonch district in Jammu and Kashmir. Three persons, including a mother-son duo, were detained by security men for questioning during the operation. An army official said personnel assisted by para commandos continued the search operation in Nar Khas forest area in Poonch.
